            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE WORTHY and noble Lord, Prince HENRY, <hi>ſonne and heire to the most puiſſant King, and</hi> our dread Souereigne, IAMES, by the grace <hi>of God, King of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Faith.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two principall offices, moſt worthy &amp; excellent Prince, of a true Chriſtian. the firſt is, To decline from euill: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, To do good. And theſe two, as they are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in all, ſo principally in thoſe, which are to command and gouerne others. But the ground of both is the true Catholike and Apoſtolike Faith; without the knowledge wherof, not only good things are often times refuſed, as euill; but alſo things euill embraced for good.</p>
            <p>Seeing then our aduerſaries the Papiſts of late time haue both violently and fraudulently ſought to bring backe into his Maieſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb facs="tcp:18506:3"/>whereof your Grace by the grace of God is vndoubted heire, not onely the hereſies and ſuperſtitions of Popiſh religion, but alſo the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall gouernment of the Pope, that is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall both to Princes and their ſtates, and alſo to all Chriſtians &amp; their liberties; I haue thoght, I could not doe either to God or my Countrey better ſeruice, then to declare to the world both their weake and abſurd grounds, and their impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and wicked doctrines, and how they haue proceeded in the maintenance and defence of the ſame. And this I doubt not would appeare far more cleerely, if without preiudice of mens perſons, or reſpect of priuat mens intereſts, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might be debated before indifferent Iudges, and ſoundly tried by the touchſtone of holy Scriptures, and none of thoſe excluded from hearing, that profeſſe true Catholicke religion.</p>
            <p>My purpoſe is not, God I take to witneſſe, to touch any man particularly, but onely to ſet forth the trueth of all matters, that the obſtacles of Chriſtian vnity, and the cauſes of the good ſucceſſe of the Turke being remoued, we may all for the moſt part conſent in the vnity of the Catholicke faith, and conioyne our mindes and forces the better to reſiſt publike enemies.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:18506:3"/>
            <p>This I preſent to your Grace, as the firſt fruits of my affection and ſeruice, that thereby learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſchew euill, and to embrace that which is good and pious, you may, as it followeth in the 34. Pſalme, <hi>ſeeke peace &amp; follow after it.</hi> Nay you may the better be inſtructed not only in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true meanes of peace, but alſo obtaine your deſires, and for euer truly poſſeſſe it. This your affection in pious promoting the true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, &amp; preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of the trecherous plots of the factious complices of Antichriſt, ſhall be the foundation of your proſperous eſtate. It ſhal increaſe the ioy of your noble Father our Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne Lord and King, and glad your Mother, whoſe hearts ioy you are. S. Iohn reioyced to ſee the children of that noble lady, to whom he directed his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>walking in trueth.</hi> And this is the affection of all your friends and wel-willers, who reioyce to ſee the heroicall vertues of your Father budding forth in your Grace. The Prophet Pſal. 112, doth aſſure vs, That <hi>his children that feareth the Lord ſhalbe mighty vpon earth, and that the generation of the righteous ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> On the other ſide the aduerſaries of religion ſhal weepe and lament, when they ſhall ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of S. Iohn, Apocalyp. 17. and 18, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:18506:4"/>the deſtruction of the great whore, and the ruines of the city of Babylon accompliſhed, and the rather, as we hope, by your Fathers and your godly endeuours and meanes. Vouchſafe therefore, moſt gracious Prince, to giue reading to this Diſcourſe made in oppoſition of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous libell, which not long ſince one <hi>Matthew Kelliſon</hi> a Prieſt of Baal, and a marked ſlaue of Antichriſt, preſumed to direct to the King your Father: and conſider what reaſon he had to talke of the ſurueying of religion, ſeeing his owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion can ſo euill abide any examination or ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey.</p>
            <p>The Lord of heauen bleſſe you with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces, and the reſt ſhalbe added vnto you.

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Vch it were to be wiſhed (Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that the ſame affection and feruent deſire were in all true Christians, and eſpecially in thoſe that are Paſtours and Teachers, to mainteine the truth, which we finde to be in falſe teachers and heretikes to vpholde and mainteine their errors. The Scribes and Phariſees in time paſt (as our Sauiour Matth. <hi>23,</hi> teacheth vs) <hi>compaſſed ſea and land to make one of their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And ſo in time paſt did the Nouatians, Donatists and Arians. But what need I to ſpeake of times past, when we ſee before our eyes the preſent example of the Maſſe-prieſts and Iebuſites, and their complices? They ſpare neither cost nor labour. ſome write, ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſome practiſe. one taketh on him one part of the labour, and another performeth the reſt. So nothing is left vnattempted, that either fraud could deuiſe, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice execute, or induſtry and labour performe.</p>
            <p>Among others, one <hi>Kelliſon</hi> (not long ſince, as is ſaid, my L. <hi>Vauxes</hi> Butler, but now a drawer of Popiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) hath ſhewed himſelfe very buſie: and for his part hath gathered together out of the libels of <hi>Staphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Cochleus, Bolſec, Sanders, William Reynolds,</hi> and other the Popes Paraſits &amp; agents, a whole packe of
<pb facs="tcp:18506:5"/>ſlanders, lies, and wicked imputations againſt <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Melancthon, Caluin, Beza,</hi> and other Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of truth. To this he hath alſo added diuers frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of certeine idle declamations of his owne, and the moſt malicious railing termes that either himſelfe could deuiſe, or els finde out in his fellowes inuectiues. And all this put together, he calleth <hi>A Suruey of the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:</hi> by the termes of Noueltie, Hereſie, Impietie, and ſuch like; ſeeking to diſgrace that Trueth which we profeſſe.</p>
            <p>I did therefore expect, that ſome learned man or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would take this fellow to taske, and indeed I doe now vnderſtand, that a man both learned, graue and eminent in this Church of England hath both vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and finiſhed the Anſwer to his ſcurrilous diſcourſe. but ſeeing the ſame is not yet publiſhed, I thought it not amiſſe in the meane while to requite his <hi>Suruey of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> with this <hi>Suruey of Popery,</hi> and to draw home this idle wandring Surueyer &amp; Searcher of other mens matters, to a carefull conſideration of his owne deſperat cauſe.</p>
            <p>His Treatiſe is moſt fooliſhly titled <hi>A Suruey of the new religion.</hi> for neither ſhall he euer prooue, that one article of our religion is new, nor doth he diſpute againſt any grounds held by vs, but only telleth of certaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauagant ſpeeches, partly falſely imputed to <hi>Luther, Caluin, Zuinglius,</hi> and other priuat men, and partly falſely gathered out of their words by falſe conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but had they held any priuat opinions, that iustly might be cenſured, what is that to vs? our religion, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, is not grounded vpon <hi>Luther, Caluin,</hi> or any late Teacher, but vpon the Prophets and Apoſtles. neither
<pb facs="tcp:18506:5"/>is our faith that, which is found in priuat mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, but that which is founded vpon holy Scriptures, and conteined in our publicke confeſsions. he might therefore with more reaſon haue called it a ſurfet of his owne fooleries and fantaſticall deuices and calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then a ſuruey of our religion.</p>
            <p>Against this idle inuention of <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> I haue, I hope, oppoſed a more diligent and certeine ſuruey of Popery. for I haue not deuiſed any thing of mine owne, but truely reported the doctrine which they teach. and herein I do not obiect whatſoeuer is taught by <hi>Scotus, Aquinas, Durandus, Biel, Stapleton, Harding, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> or which other Doctours do holde ſingulerly, nor that which <hi>Sanders, Parſons,</hi> or ſuch idle fellowes babble in their trifling books, but only that which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defined in ſome Councell, or determined by ſome Pope, or generally taught or practiſed by all, or moſt, or beſt of our aduerſaries, and which I thinke <hi>Kelliſon</hi> will not deny. And by theſe grounds, doctrines and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes I hope to ouerthrow the whole frame and building of Popery, being layd vpon weake grounds, and conſiſting of many wicked and falſe doctrines, and being maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by moſt leud and wicked meanes and practiſes.</p>
            <p>This Diſcourſe I firſt deuiſed for a priuat friend, whoſe wauering (for I will not ſay defection, vntill I ſee ſurther) I do much lament, and whoſe ſettlement I doe much deſire. but becauſe I doe thinke the ſame may doe good to many, who not knowing the trueth we hold, nor the errours, hereſies, ſuperſtitions, idolatry and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Popery, do runne headlong vpon occaſion either of malcontentment, or deſire of innouation in matters of State, which they conſider may ſooneſt be ſtirred by
<pb facs="tcp:18506:6"/>quarrels about religion, into ſtrange courſes; I haue beene perſwaded to make it common. the ſame alſo may ſerue to reclaime the moſt haggard Papiſts, if they doe not wilfully ſhut their eyes, and ſtoppe their eares againſt the trueth. thirdly, this may ſerue to ſtoppe the mouth of the ſlandrous Iebuſites and Maſſe-priests, that impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to vs wicked opinions and practiſes no way defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, are vnable to defend their owne doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, which they publikely profeſſe, and commend. ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, I hope wiſe Chriſtians may learne by theſe collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ours, neither to truſt the aduerſary, who maketh no conſcience of lying or ſlandring, nor to condemne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent men, before they be heard and conuicted.</p>
            <p>Vouchſafe therefore (gentle Reader) to reade our Diſcourſe with attention, and to iudge without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. and then I doubt not but thou wilt beware both of the impious doctrines, and of the iniurious and leud practiſes of Popery.</p>
            <p>If any be offended with this ſurueying courſe, let him impute the fault to <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> who of a drunken butler, is now become a mad ſurueyer. and if he finde not texts or proofs ſufficient to ſatisfie his humour in proofe of euery allegation in this Treatiſe; let him thinke, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are of that nature, that either they will be confeſſed of the aduerſary, or els are notoriouſly knowen to the world, though impudently denied by the polſhorne packe of Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, as there is but one Faith, one Baptiſme, one God; ſo there is but one true religion, which euery one is to know and to embrace, if he will be ſaued. And this is grounded vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt being the chiefe corner ſtone.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18506:8"/>and vnder colour whereof they abuſe ſimple ſoules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſuing their puddle waters of Popery made ſweete with ſome truth, for the pure ſtreames of Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
               <p>By popery therefore wee vnderſtand not any point of Chriſtian doctrine generally holden of all Chriſtians, or the doctrine of the Prophets or holy Apoſtles profeſſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the ancient fathers, and truly termed Catholike (for that we hold and profeſſe as well as the Papiſtes, and farre more ſyncerely than they, albeit we deteſt and renounce all Popery) but all thoſe errors and corruptions in doctrine both concerning faith and manners, which the ſynagogue of Rome &amp; her louers by colour of the Popes authority, and by his perſwaſion and enforcement from time to time baue receiued, profeſſed and taught, either contrary to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp; inſtitution of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or elſe aboue the ſame, and aboue the faith of the ancient primitiue church. Neither doe wee otherwiſe ſingle Popery from Chriſtian religion, than the ancient Catholickes did diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>Arianiſme, Macedonianiſme, Neſtorianiſme, Eutychia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Pelagianiſme,</hi> and other hereſies from the true faith. for although the <hi>Arians, Macedonians, Neſtorians, Eutychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Pelagians,</hi> and other heretickes did hold in termes the articles of the faith; yet for that the firſt denied the diuinity of the ſonne of God, the ſecond the diuinity of the holie ghoſt, the third the vnion of the two natures in the perſon of Chriſt, the fourth the verity of Chriſtes humane nature, the fift the neceſſitie of Gods grace, and added diuers nouel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the ancient faith; they were reputed heretickes, and by their hereſies ancient Chriſtians vnderſtood not any point of Chriſtian faith, but their ſinguler opinions, which they maintained obſtinately againſt the faith.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles in the Primitiue Church, did teach that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they had receiued from <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the ſame to their ſucceſſours, and they to others. the firſt Chriſtians likewiſe receiued the ſame pure, and without corruption. but as the enuious man, while the men of the houſe ſlept, ſowed tares among good corne, as wee read
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18506:8"/>Matth. 13. ſo falſe Apoſtles and heretickes from time to time haue gone about with their cockle and tares to corrupt the ſyncere doctrine of the faith, abuſing the negligence of true teachers to their owne aduantage; but yet none more cunningly and fraudulently, than the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their complices. for other heretickes were ſoone eſpied by their oppoſition to the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp; Chriſts true Church, timely bewraying themſelues, but theſe vnder the titles of Apoſtolicke men and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes haue corrupted the Apoſtolicke and Catholicke faith, and vnder the name and title of the Church haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined the foundations and doctrine of the Church, and vnder their ſheepes clothing haue couered their rauening and wooluiſh natures. and ſo haue they lurked many yeeres mingling their traditions and inuentions with the doctrines of faith, and for truth deliuering erroneous and ſuperſtitious doctrines, and vnder the name of Chriſt endeuouring to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the kingdome of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>At the firſt they clogged religion with diuers ſuperfluous and ſuperſtitious ceremonies, &amp; loaded Chriſtians with the burthen of their decretales and cenſures. but in the end they corrupted both the worſhip of God, &amp; the doctrine of faith. <hi>Boniface the</hi> 3. obtained of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be reputed head of other churches. and this was the beginning of the Popes ſupremacy. In the wicked aſſembly vnder <hi>Irene</hi> that ſemipagan empreſſe at <hi>Nice</hi> the doctrine of the worſhip of images began firſt to be eſtabliſhed. &amp; this the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> willingly embraced, vſing this occaſion to eſtabliſh their own kingdome, &amp; to free themſelues from the gouernment of the Emperour. then alſo the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip of Saints reliques began to be authoriſed, and vnwritten traditions vnder the title of Apoſtolicke authority to be commended, as appeareth in the third action of that ſynode. The French king <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and his father <hi>Pipin</hi> and other their ſucceſſors endowed the church of <hi>Rome</hi> with great temporall poſſeſſions, which made them ſtrong and powerfull.</p>

                  <hi>Nicolas</hi> the 2. in a certein ſynode at Rome firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that Chriſtes body was preſent in the euchariſt, and handled with the prieſts hands, and preſſed with the teeth: and this fell out about the yeare of our Lord 1059.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. firſt beganne to handle the temporall ſword, and manifeſtly to oppoſe himſelfe againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> emperor. before his time, ſaith <hi>Otho Friſingenſis,</hi> we doe not read of any Emperor excommunicated by the Pope.

               <p>The doctrine of tranſubſtantiation was firſt eſtabliſhed by Innocent the third in a ſynode at <hi>Lateran,</hi> about the yeare of our Lord 1215. then alſo came in the neceſſity of auri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The communion vnder one kind was brought in firſt by the ſynode at Conſtance about the yeare of our Lord 1414. there alſo it was decreed, that the accidents in the euchariſt did ſubſiſt without a ſubiect.</p>
               <p>In the conuenticle of Florence about the yeare of our Lord 1439. the doctrine of purgatorie, and the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy was decreed by the authority of the ſynode. there alſo the doctrine of the 7. ſacraments was firſt propounded to the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as proceeding from the ſynode. neither doe we read of the forme of extreme vnction, and other Popiſh ſacraments there ſet downe, before this time.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the errors and ſuperſtitions of Popery were eſtabliſhed and confirmed in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of our Lord 1564. for before that time the ſchoolemen diſputed <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra.</hi> but ſince that, they haue made it vnlawfull to hold otherwiſe, then that ſynode preſcribeth, in matters there newly determined.</p>
               <p>Now they haue as it were giuen a perfect forme, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18506:9"/>full authoritie to that doctrine, which before was not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perfectly knowen of all, or in all pointes allowed of all. ſo that whatſoeuer the Papiſtes vant of the antiquitie of their doctrine; yet it is moſt euident, that the full eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of it, as it is now deliuered, cannot be proued or ſhewed before this conuenticle. then their miſſals, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiaries and offices receiued a great alteration, or rather a new forme. then they innouated diuers points of doctrine both concerning faith, and manners.</p>
               <p>To relate all the particular errors and abuſes of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Church were a matter infinite. for there is no point almoſt, wherein the Papiſts varie not from the auntient Church, the article concerning the holy Trinitie excepted. beſide that they vary in their doctrine and practiſe dailie. but the principall points of Popery, wherein we charge them to haue digreſſed from the doctrine of the Apoſtles and primitiue Church of Chriſt, are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt they haue taught nouelties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and falſe doctrine concerning the verie grounds of faith. the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that the Church is built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt being the Cheefe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone. but they beleeue the church to be built vpon the Pope. <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. ſaith <hi>that the Apoſtles did firſt preach the Goſpell, and afterward deliuer the ſame in ſcriptures, that they might be a foundation and pillar of our faith.</hi> they doe make the traditions of the church not written equall to the ſcriptures, and vpon them, nay vpon the decretales of Popes, and practiſe of Maſſeprieſtes doe build their faith. all antiquitie eſteemeth holy ſcriptures to be the canon of our faith, and therefore calleth them canonicall. But the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> eſteeme them to be an vnperfect canon without their traditions, and the Popes decretales and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verb. dei c.</hi> 4. ſaith <hi>they are neither neceſſary, nor ſufficient without traditions.</hi> The fathers neuer accounted the bookes of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith, Eccleſiaſticus, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and the <hi>Machabees</hi> equall to the bookes of the law and Prophets extant originally in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> as appeareth by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18506:10"/>the teſtimony of <hi>Hierome</hi> in prologo Galeato, of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in <hi>ſynopſi,</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in carm. of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and diuers others old and new writers. the Papiſts in the ſynode of <hi>Trent</hi> decree them to be of equall authoritie with the reſt. the auncient catholikes euer eſteemed the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of the old teſtament, and the Greeke of the new to be more authentical, then anie tranſlation. the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> hath made the old latin vulgar tranſlation of the bible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall: and doth not giue that honor to the originall bookes of the bible. the canonicall ſcriptures, we ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their force from the author of them. and this is to be prooued by the conſent of fathers, and by arguments from ſcriptures, law and reaſon. they ſay that ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue force and authoritie in reſpect of vs from the Church, or rather from the Pope. Papiſts are neither willing, that ſcriptures be turned into vulgar tongues, nor will permitte them to be read of the vulgar ſort without licence, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly read in vulgar tongues in the church. finally they ſay they are obſcure and hard to be vnderſtood, and ſpeake what they can in their diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Secondly they teach erroneouſly concerning Chriſts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and concerning his office. the body of <hi>Christ</hi> they beleeue to be both in heauen, and on earth on euerie altar at one and the ſelfe ſame time. they alſo hold, that his body is really vnder the accidents of bread and wine, giuing him a body neither viſible nor palpable, nor in any ſort like to ours. they teach further, that his body is in diuers places, where it filleth not the places, and that his one body hath relation to diuers places. they beleeue, that the ſoules of the faithfull before Chriſtes comming were in hell, or at leaſt in Limbo, which is a part of hell, and were thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered by <hi>Chriſtes</hi> going to hell, as if his croſſe had wrought nothing for them. they teach that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as man is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, and per conſequent omnipotent, and that he was <hi>vir perfectus,</hi> that is, <hi>a perfect or growne man</hi> from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of his conception. his office of mediation they giue to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Angels and to Saints, they make alſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18506:10"/>Saints our redeemers, teaching, that by their merits Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians obteine their deſires, and are deliuered out of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie. to Maſſe-prieſts they giue prieſthood according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and ſay that they offer vp Chriſts body and blood really for quicke and dead. finally they make the Pope head, ſpouſe and monarke of the Church.</p>
               <p>Neither doe they teach more catholikely of Chriſtes myſticall body, then of his naturall body. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for they ſubiect the ſame to the Pope, and exclude all from Chriſt, that are not ſubiect to the Pope, the true members thereof they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute, and make heretikes and reprobates, and ſuch as liue without order or law, profeſſing their religion outwardly, true members of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body. the Church, ſay they, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo conſpicuous and viſible, that euery one may ſee it and diſcerne it. the true markes of the church, that is, true doctrine, and the ſincere adminiſtration of Sacraments, and holineſſe of life, they denie, aſſigning moſt common and vncerteine markes, as vnitie, vniuerſalitie, antiquitie, ſucceſſion and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The Pope they make a moſt certeine and infallible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Scriptures, and iudge of matters of faith. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> they giue him authoritie to make lawes for the whole Church, and power to binde mens conſciences. they make him more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne then a generall Councell, and ſay that his power in giuing indulgences reacheth into purgatorie. they ſay he hath power to excommunicate and depoſe kings, and to giue away their kingdomes to others.</p>
               <p>Betwixt the Catholicke church and Roman church they make no difference equalling a part to the whole. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> they ſay alſo, that the Roman church can neither erre nor faile.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of God conſiſteth in ſpirit and trueth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but they place the ſame in certeine externall rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and in meere humane inuentions and deuices. nay for God they worſhip creatures, not onely giuing diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Sacrament, but alſo to crucifixes and images of the Trinitie made of wood, ſtone and colours. they doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo adore not onely ſaints, but rotten bones and ragges, they
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18506:11"/>know not of whom. to Saints they pray, they make vowes, they confeſſe their ſinnes: to ſaints they erect churches and altars: to their images they burne incenſe and preſent diuers oblations, and finally in the honour of Saints haue deuiſed particular maſſes and offices, transforming the Pſalmes and wordes of Scriptures to Angels and Saints.</p>
               <p>Their doctrine concerning the Sacraments is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant. for they doe not onely adde vnto water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ſalt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ſpittle, oile, and diuers other ceremonies, partly idle, partly ſuperſtitious, but alſo vnto the two Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, they equall confirmation, matrimonie, penance, orders, and extreme vnction, making them Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as Baptiſme or the Lords Supper. in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation they haue deuiſed both a new ſigne and new wordes. in extreme Vnction they haue deuiſed new formes. in the ordring of Prieſtes they ſay, <hi>accipe potestatem offerendi ſacriſicium in eccleſia pro viuis &amp; mortuis,</hi> that is, receiue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to offer ſacrifice in the church for quicke and dead. in Penance they vrge a neceſſity of confeſſion, ſtrange formes of whipping, and vncerteine hopes and new deuices of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. from Matrimonie they exclude Prieſtes, monkes and friars, and make it a Sacrament, albeit they know neither certeine ſignes, nor words of the inſtitution of it. but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Lords ſupper they haue quite aboliſhed. for that which Chriſt ordeined to be receiued of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, that the maſſe-prieſt doth offer for quicke &amp; dead, and in the honour of Saints and Angels, of which there is not one worde ſpoken in the inſtitution. our Sauiour in bread and wine inſtituted his laſt ſupper. theſe neither leaue bread nor wine, but make Chriſtians eaters of mans fleſh, and drinkers of mans blood like the canibals, &amp; Cyclopes. Chriſt ordeined this Sacrament in remembrance of his death and paſſion. theſe make of the ſame a ſacrifice in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Angels and Saints. the cup of the new teſtament they take from Chriſtians, abrogating, as much as in them lieth, the new teſtament eſtabliſhed in Chriſts blood. and yet they ſay Chriſtians ſinne mortally, if they heare not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18506:11"/>Maſſe euery Sunday and holiday.</p>
               <p>Of grace they ſpeake, as men deuoid of grace, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> for by grace, by which we are ſaued, and made acceptable to God, they vnderſtand nothing elſe but either charity, or a habit not diſtinct from Charity. ſo that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they exclude not grace from the worke of our ſaluation, yet making grace a habit or vertue, they ouerthrow grace, and aſcribe the merit of our ſaluation, not to Gods mercie through Chriſt, nor to the merit of his Paſſion, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to our owne workes and merites. diuers of them ſaie that men are predeſtinated for their merites foreſeene, and all hold, that men were reprobated for their ſinnes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene before. they ſay further, that the vnregenerat hath freewill as well as the regenerat, and that not onely in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this life, but alſo to doe workes of piety and other ſupernaturall effectes.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of faith they haue alſo much corrupted. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> for they make Charity the forme of faith, as if faith were without forme or life of it ſelfe, and as if the iuſt man did not liue by faith. to this purpoſe they ſay that not onlie wicked and reprobat men, but alſo the diuels of hell maie haue true and iuſtifying faith. they hold further, that by faith we are not onely to hold whatſoeuer is conteined in holy ſcriptures, but alſo whatſoeuer is deliuered by traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or determined by the Pope. and laſtly that no man is to beleeue, that he ſhall aſſuredly be ſaued, but rather to hold, that he that is truly iuſtified, may be damned.</p>
               <p>Concerning the law of God they teach both contrary to reaſon and law. for firſt they cut out the 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> commandement in their offices of our Lady and their primers, becauſe it cannot well ſtand with the Popiſh worſhip of images. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they teach that concupiſcence without our conſent is not ſinne, albeit the law ſay, <hi>non concupiſces. thirdly</hi> they ſay, that it is ſinne as well to tranſgreſſe the Popes decrees, as Gods lawes. <hi>fourthly</hi> they beleeue, that the Pope is able either to diſſolue the law, as for example, where he abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ſubiectes from their obedience to princes, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18506:12"/>from their duty to parents, or at the leaſt to diſpenſe with the tranſgreſſors of the law, as for example, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſons, adulterers, Sodomites, murtherers, aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, theeues, ſacrilegious perſons and ſuch like. fiftly they beleeue that a man is able perfectly to fulfill the law. of which it followeth that man is able to liue without all ſinne, which as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſheweth <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de bono perſeuerat. c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5, and <hi>Hierome aduerſ. Pelag.</hi> is flat Pelagianiſme.</p>
               <p>In their doctrine of praiers they offend much. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> yet is the practiſe of Papiſts farre worſe, than their doctrine in this point. our Sauiour teacheth vs to goe to his father in his name: they go to God by the interceſſion of Saints. nay of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they run to Saints, Angels, and the bleſſed Virgin without once thinking of God, eſpecially if they thinke no more than they vtter in their praiers. they pray in a tongue which they vnderſtand not, which is rather prating than praying. they pray for remiſſion of ſinnes for the dead, not knowing whether they bee damned or no. they pray before ſtockes and ſtones. nay they put their truſt in them. for if this were not ſo, why ſhould they hope for better ſucceſſe at the image of our Lady of <hi>Loreto</hi> or <hi>Monſerat,</hi> than at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther image or forme of our Lady?</p>
               <p>They beleeue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> that almes ſatisfie for ſinnes, and that thoſe are beſt beſtowed, that are giuen to Monkes and Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſuch idle vagabonds and plagues of ſtates: whereas the firſt ouerthroweth <hi>Chriſts</hi> merits and ſatisfaction, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is an occaſion of all the miſchiefes brewed by theſe mothes of religion, and blemiſhes of ſtate.</p>
               <p>They teach, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> that it is mortall ſinne, not to faſt on Saints vigiles, embre daies, and other times appointed by the Pope, and that faſting ſtandeth in eating fiſh, and abſtaining from our ſuppers and ſuch obſeruances, and finally that ſuch faſts doe not only ſatisfie for ſinnes, but alſo merit heauen.</p>

               <p>Neither can they well auoid ſinne, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> that know not what ſinne is. The virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by moſt of them is acquited from originall ſinne. and they define ſinne to bee, not onely the tranſgreſſion of the law of God, but alſo euery tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the law of the Pope; nay euery breach of the law of man, which vtterly taketh away the difference betwixt the lawes of God and man.</p>
               <p>Of the ſtate of ſoules departed they ſeeme to know little truly, although ſome ſay, they know too much. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> for they do not ſay as we doe, that there are two waies after this life, the one of the faithfull to eternall life, the other of the wicked to eternall death, but they ſay, that ſome go into purgatorie, and others into <hi>limbus puerorum.</hi> and out of purgatory they ſay ſoules are deliuered partly by maſſes, and partly by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.</p>
               <p>All theſe points of erroneous &amp; falſe doctrine, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which either contrarie, or beſide the word of God, the Pope, and his complices haue inuented, and brought into the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we call Popery. and this is the ſubiect of this diſcourſe, and the doctrine againſt which we diſpute. let no man therefore thinke, becauſe the Papiſts maintaine many points of Chriſtian religion, that either we reprehend that truth, which they and we defend, or that they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the errors of Popery, becauſe they hold ſome trueth. but either let them iuſtifie their errors; or elſe they ſhall bee forced to confeſſe, that the proper doctrine of Popery is wicked and erroneous.</p>

               <p>AS Popery is diuers from Chriſtian religion, ſo hath the ſame other foundations than Chriſtian religion. The doctors of <hi>Trent</hi> in the fourth ſeſſion of that ſynode
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18506:13"/>hauing pronounced them <hi>anathema,</hi> that ſhall not receiue all the bookes of the Bible, as they are found in the old Latin vulgar tranſlation, and read in the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for holy and canonicall, or that ſhall wittinglie contemne the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that church, doe ſignifie that this is the <hi>foundation of the confeſſion of faith,</hi> which they meant to publiſh. ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth they ground their faith beſide canonicall ſcriptures vpon apocryphall writings of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith, Wiſedome, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus</hi> and the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and diuers fragments of books not found in the Hebrew text of the Bible, and vpon traditions not written, but deliuered from hand to hand from the Apoſtles, as they ſay, and ſo come to their hands. but where they ſpeake of ſcriptures, it is to be obſerued, that they doe not ſimply allow them, but as they are contained in the old vulgar tranſlation, and as they are expounded by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> thoſe which vnder any pretence doe reiect the old tranſlation, or vſe any interpretation contrary to the Romiſh Churches meaning, they condemne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his booke intituled <hi>Principia doctrinalia</hi> doth deliuer vnto vs ſeuen grounds or principles of his religion. the firſt is <hi>the Church,</hi> the ſecond <hi>the Pope,</hi> the third <hi>the means vſed by the Pope in iudgement,</hi> the fourth <hi>the Popes infallibility in iudgement,</hi> the fifth <hi>his power in taxing the canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> the ſixth <hi>his certaine interpretation of Scriptures,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth <hi>his power in deliuering doctrine not written.</hi> theſe I ſay are his grounds and principles abſurdly deuiſed, confuſedly diſpoſed, and ridiculouſly propounded, as God willing, ſhall be ſhewed otherwhere. now it is ſufficient to declare, that whatſoeuer he bableth elſewhere of ſcriptures, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels &amp; fathers, yet heere they are all ſuppreſſed in this diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at the leaſt concealed vnder the name of the Church, or Pope, which in his preface to <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. hee calleth <hi>ſupremum numen in terris,</hi> that is, <hi>the ſupreme God of the world,</hi> and who to him is all in all. likewiſe in his preface to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of doctrinall principles, hee ſeemeth directly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſcriptures. <hi>Chriſtianae religionis fundamentum habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ab ipſis literis apoſtolicis &amp; euangelicis uliud.</hi> that

               <p>The decretale epiſtles of the Pope no doubt they admit for the foundation of their faith. for in the rubricke of their decrees c. <hi>in canonicis. diſt.</hi> 19. they doe determine that <hi>the Popes decretales are to bee numbred among canonicall ſcriptures. inter canonicas ſcripturas,</hi> ſay they, <hi>decretales epiſtolae connume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur.</hi> likewiſe <hi>Gelaſius c. ſancta Romana. diſt.</hi> 15. defineth that <hi>the Popes decretale epiſtles are to bee receiued with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame decretale <hi>Gelaſius</hi> authoriſeth the Romane martyrologe or legends of martyrs. neither can <hi>Kelliſon,</hi> or his kettle companions deny this to be one of the grounds of his rammiſh, I would ſay <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion, ſeeing theſe martyrologes and legendes conteine diuers traditions, which the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> will haue all Papiſtes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue with equall affection to ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canus lib.</hi> 1. <hi>loc. theolog. c.</hi> 1. aſſigneth tenne places, out of which he ſaith, diuines are to draw arguments. the firſt is the authority of ſcriptures. the ſecond the authority of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not written. the third is the authority of the catholike church. the fourth the authority of councels. the fifth the authority of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> where wee are to note that more honeſtly than his companions hee maketh the church of <hi>Rome</hi> to differ from the Catholike church. the ſixth is the authority of ancient fathers. the ſeuenth the authority of Romiſh ſchoole doctors. the eighth naturall reaſon. the ninth the authority of Philoſophers. the tenth the authority of writers of ſtories. ſo wee ſee how hee buildeth his faith vpon men, as well as vpon God, and matcheth traditions not written with the moſt diuine writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and conioyneth the authority of councels and fathers, nay of ſchoolemen and Philoſophers with the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18506:14"/>teſtimony of holy ſcriptures framing to vs rather an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane then a diuine foundation of Chriſtian faith.</p>

                  <hi>Martin Perez</hi> a plaine dealing Papiſt knowing, that all thoſe points of doctrine, which are in controuerſie betwixt his fellowes and vs, are grounded rather vpon tradition then ſcripture, doth entitle his whole diſcourſe of theſe matters, <hi>de traditionibus,</hi> that is, <hi>a diſcourſe of traditions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Pontif.

               <p>This then being found in the ſuruey of the grounds of Popiſh religion, let vs alſo conſider what concluſions may be hence inferred, that we may as well ſuruey the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the premiſſes. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> it followeth, that theſe grounds being blaſphemous both in regard of the ſpirit of God which is the enditer and author of holy ſcriptures, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in regard of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> the foundation of the church
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18506:14"/>and finiſher of our ſaith, the doctrine and religion of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery cannot be cleere of blaſphemie. for to match Popiſh decretales with holy ſcriptures, and the Popes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with Gods law, is derogatory to Gods holy ſpirit, and a plaine diſparagement to Gods holy law. likewiſe it is blaſphemous to accuſe the holy ſcriptures of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and imperfection, and to attribute more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and perſpicuitie to the decretales of the Pope, then to the lawes of God. it is alſo blaſphemous either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of the foundation of the church, or at the leaſt to ioyne the Pope with him in the foundation, and that as a more neceſſary foundation for the knowledge of Chriſtian religion, as <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſaith. the ſame alſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the words of the Apoſtle. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and of <hi>S. Iames. c.</hi> 4. in the firſt of which places we finde, that no other foundation can be layd of the church, but <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> in the 2. we reade, <hi>that the Church is founded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Chriſt being the cheefe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone.</hi> in the 3. we vnderſtand, that there is only one Law-giuer and Iudge, <hi>which is able to ſaue and deſtroy.</hi> it is finally very impious and blaſphemous to aſſirme, that the Pope is a more certaine and ſuperiour Iudge, then God himſelfe ſpeaking to vs in ſcriptures, or then the Apoſtles and Prophets, that were ledde into all truth by the ſpirit of God. of other blaſphemies of Popery we ſhall haue further occaſion to ſpeake hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> ſeeing the Papiſtes are not certaine of their grounds, it muſt needes follow, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that the religion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts is moſt vncertaine. that they cannot be certain of their grounds diuers arguments declare. for neither are they certaine whether <hi>Clement, Leo,</hi> or any other ſitting in the Popes chayre be true Pope. nor canne they aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether the decretales, which goe vnder the names of Popes, were indeed their decretales, whoſe names they cary. <hi>Antonius Contius</hi> a learned Papiſt in a certaine anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his added to the <hi>ch. ſancta. diſt.</hi> 15. in <hi>Plantins editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that all the decretales ſet out vnder names of Popes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18506:15"/>before Silueſter,</hi> are falſe. and this he ſaith he hath <hi>ſhewed manifeſtly. further</hi> it cannot be proned, that all the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Popes are right and equall. nay contrarie, we haue by diuers moſt certeine demonſtrations prooued, that both concerning ſcriptures, faith, the law, ſacraments, praier, the worſhip of God, and diuers pointes of faith they haue determined contrary to the rule of ſaith, as ſhall hereafter more particularly appeare. <hi>Thirdly</hi> it were plaine impudencie to ſay, that the Apoſtles inſtituted the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Paſchal Lambes, the forme of hallowing of churches, ſalt, water, and all Popiſh trinkets, the form of praying vpon beades, and the reſt of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions. neither ſhall <hi>Kelliſon</hi> euer be able to iuſtifie all thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, which his teachers haue receiued by tradition, and publikely heretofore ſet forth, and now read out of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendes. <hi>Fourthly</hi> diuers of thoſe 84. <hi>canons,</hi> which goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the names of the Apoſtles are diſclaymed by the Papiſts themſelues, and the reſt cannot be proued, that they were made by the Apoſtles. of the actes of the Nicene Councell the Papiſts themſelues haue no certainty.

Nay ſome of them doe containe doctrine contrary to the faith profeſſed by the fathers. ſixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are not certaine either what is the ſenſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane church, diuers doctors yeelding diuers interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſcriptures, or what is the old Latine tranſlation. for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18506:15"/>
                  <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> ſetteth out the old vulgar Latin tranſlation after one ſort, and <hi>Clement</hi> the eight after another. and he that alloweth the tranſlation of <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> muſt nedes condemne that of <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, &amp; contrariwiſe. finally ſeeing diuers Papiſts aſſigne diuers grounds of their faith, and ſcarce two of many doe agree in all points concerning their foundations and the aſſurance of them; how can they pretend either vnity, or certainty in their religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> the foundations of Popery being laid vpon falſe decretals, and lying legends, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> hardly ſhall our aduerſaries be able to deny their religion to be falſe, and full of lies. that the Popes doe in their decretales report notorious lyes it is apparent by the decretale ſet out vnder the name of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius. c. quis neſciat. diſt.</hi> 11. where he denieth, that anie taught or gathered churches in France, Spaine, Afrike, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>beſide S.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Pope being the foundation of the church, it followeth, that as oft as the Pope dieth, the church is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out foundation. it followeth alſo that the Pope going to hell, as it appeareth by the chap. <hi>Sipapa. diſt.</hi> 40. that he may, the foundation of the Church ſhould lie in hell. that the Pope falling into hereſie, as <hi>Liberius, Honorius</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn the</hi> 22. and diuers others haue done, that the Church ſhould faile; which be matters abſurd, and impious to affirme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> feeing diuers old traditions are now out of vſe, as for example, that of celebrating baptiſme at Eaſter, and praying ſtanding betwixt Eaſter and Whitſontide, and of praying with our faces turned to the Eaſt, and ſuch like, it muſt needes be granted, that the foundations of Popery are ruinous. for why may not the like happen to other traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to theſe? and if traditions be temporary and ruinous, which they make equall to holy ſcriptures, what can they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for the continuance and perpetuity of the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretales, which are not only contrarie to holy Scriptures, but alſo repugnant one to another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> there can bee no conſent or vnity in the points of Popiſh doctrine, for that the ſame conſiſteth of contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of Popes, and is grounded vpon contrary traditions, contrary legends, contrary interpretations of fathers and ſchoolemen, and either of traditions or decretales contrary to ſcriptures, or of ſentences of fathers contrary to decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, and Romiſh traditions.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the wicked doctrine of Papiſtes concerning the law of God, and the performance thereof.</head>
               <p>LOng it were to relate all the wicked and falſe doctrines of Popery in euery point of Chriſtian faith. beſide that the ſame is performed largely by diuers learned men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ample volumes. we will therefore heere ſpeake onely of ſome principall points of religion, and ſhew how they haue beene by our aduerſaties moſt notoriouſly abuſed and corrupted, and ſo proceed to intreat of the beginnings, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, impieties, falſities, contradictions, and other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and defects, that are generally found in Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> then wee finde, that they haue not only taught im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly of Gods law, but alſo reiected the ſame for their owne traditions. generallie they hold that the Popes lawes bind in conſcience, and that it is ſinne to tranſgreſſe them. but if this were ſo, then were not the knowledge of ſinne by the law, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, neither were the law of God perfect, nor a certaine rule of Chriſtian life, nor were God the onely lawgiuer, that could ſaue and deſtroy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſtat. peccat. c.</hi> 3. ſaith that there are certaine ſinnes, or tranſgreſſions of the law, ſo light and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that they deſerue not eternall death. but this doth fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſanction or vigour of the law, that pronounceth them <hi>accurſed, which continue not in all things, which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the booke of the law to do them,</hi> as we read Galat. 3.</p>
               <p>The Scotiſts and moſt Papiſts now hold, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was neither conceiued in ſinne, nor euer committed ſinne. but the Apoſtle Rom. 5, ſaith, that by one man ſinne entred into the world, <hi>and death by ſinne went ouer all.</hi> and Galat. 3. he ſheweth how <hi>the ſcripture hath concluded all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All of them hold, that in the regenerate concupiſcence
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18506:17"/>is no ſinne. yet can they not deny, but that concupiſcence is forbidden by the law of God. and thereupon the Iebuſites in their cenſure of <hi>Colein</hi> denie all to bee ſinne, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the law of God. Let Chriſtians therefore ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine whether they will follow the Apoſtle, that ſheweth ſin to bee knowen by the law, and that concupiſcence is ſinne, or the Iebuſites denying the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Iebuſites of <hi>Collein fol.</hi> 194. affirm, that what the law commandeth concerning the loue of God with our whole hart, mind &amp; ſoule, pertaineth not to vs in this life. as if God had giuen a law to ſoules in the life to come, and not to men in this life. this error our Sauiour confuteth Matth. 22. where he aſſoileth the Scribes queſtion concerning the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt commandement in the law.</p>
               <p>The ſame fellowes <hi>fol.</hi> 48. affirme that a regenerate man is able to performe the law of God perfectly. but if this be ſo; then they are deepe plunged in the hereſie of the Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians, who were condemned for holding, that Chriſtians are able to liue without all ſinne.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts teach, that we are to bee iuſtified and ſaued by the workes of the law. but the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth contrarie, <hi>that the law is the miniſter of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The law of God forbiddeth vs the hauing of other gods beſide him, in which commandement wee are alſo forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to giue the honour of God to creatures. but Papiſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide God in heauen haue a God on earth, as appeareth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by the chap. <hi>ſatis diſt.</hi> 96. and diuers gloſſes of cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and gloſing flatteries of Papiſtes. they worſhip the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament alſo as God, and <hi>Bellarmine lib. de monachis c.</hi> 14. doth call Saints <hi>Gods by participation.</hi> the honour of God they giue to Saints and Angels, yea to the images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of the Croſſe, and of the Trinity. in the honour of Angels and Saints they ſay maſſes, and offices, they erect churches, altars, and images, and burne incenſe vnto them. they call vpon them, ſweare by them, make vowes, and confeſſe their ſinnes vnto them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond law of the firſt table prohibiteth the making
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18506:17"/>of grauen images. to the intent to bow vnto them, and to worſhip them. but Papiſtes do both make them, and praie and crouch before them. they do alſo offer gifts, and burne incenſe vnto them, as the heathen did to their idols. nay, which the heathen did neuer, they giue the ſame honour to a picture of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> or of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which they giue to God himſelfe. praying to the Croſſe they ſay, <hi>ô Croſſe of Chriſt protect me, ô Croſſe of Chriſt defend mee from all euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third law forbid deth periury, the vaine vſe of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and all abuſes of Gods holy name and word. but little is the ſame regarded by the Pope and his complices. for they do not onely breake their oathes, but alſo lightly diſpenſe with periured perſons. <hi>Gregory the ſeuenth,</hi> as in his life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, forſwore the papacy, and yet regarded not his oath. the like we find related of Pope <hi>Formoſus.</hi> commonly they looſe and aſſoile ſubiects from the bond of their oath to Princes. <hi>abſoluit Gregorius</hi> 7. <hi>omnes a iuramento, quos fidei te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit obligatio,</hi> ſaith he that wrote the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth. <hi>Paſchal</hi> the ſecond hauing ſolemnly ſworne to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour preſently brake his oath, as we may ſee in <hi>Otho Friſingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and diuers other hiſtoriographers. <hi>Gregory the twelſth,</hi> as <hi>Theodoric. à Niem</hi> teſtifieth <hi>tract. vnion.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 29. was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickely accounted <hi>a periured perſon, periurus publicus.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18506:18"/>
                  <hi>that it ſhould be lawfull, to recall all couenants and promiſes made by the Popes predeceſſors.</hi> that impious fellow <hi>Pius the</hi> 5. in his Bul againſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of pious memory did excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate ſuch, <hi>as would not take armes againſt her.</hi> and yet her ſubiects were ſworne to obey her. all Papiſts commonly are great ſwearers and forſwearers. in the Roman Catechiſme in 2. <hi>mandat.</hi> they complaine that their people were giuen <hi>to ſwearing and curſing. Quis non videat,</hi> ſay they, <hi>omnia iure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurando aſſirmari, omnia imprecationibus &amp; execrationibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferta eſſe?</hi> they ſweare by ſaints, bread, ſalt, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, infringing Gods commandement Deut. 6. that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth men to ſweare by his name. Finally the Popes and their complices moſt ſhamefully wreſt and turne ſcriptures, making them ſerue to their humours and pleaſures.</p>
               <p>The fourth commandement concerneth the ſanctifying of the Sabbath. but the Papiſts profane it by worſhiping Idols, and frequenting the idolatrous maſſe. <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond vpon the ſolemne day of Eaſter fought a bloudy bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell with the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> vpon the ſabbath maſſacred the Saints of God at <hi>Vaſſi.</hi> and ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle do they reſpect the Lords honour, that they make more account of our ladies feſtiuals, and of the daies of <hi>Francis, Dominicke,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> then of the Lords day.</p>
               <p>The fifth commandement requireth obedience of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to parents, and of ſubiects to princes. yet <hi>Gregory the ſeuenth, Paſchall the ſecond, Alexander the third</hi> and diuers Popes by their decretales haue armed the ſonne againſt the father, and the ſubiect againſt his prince. neither was the late league of the French rebels againſt <hi>Henry the third</hi> and <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> ſet forward and confirmed by other more, then by the Pope. the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtirred vp rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt <hi>Henry the eight</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and againſt <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.

               <p>The ſixth commandement forbiddeth murder. But Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts thinke they doe God good ſeruice, when they murder true Chriſtians. from this fountaine haue proceeded all their cruell executions in <hi>England, France, Italy, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Spaine</hi> and other countries. <hi>Natalis Come;</hi> in his hiſtory teſtifieth that in the maſſacre of <hi>France An. D.</hi> 1572. they murdred aboue ſixty thouſand of all ſorts of perſons. their garments are died in the blood of innocentes. nay they cruelly poiſon and murther thoſe of their owne religion, if they be oppoſite vnto them in faction. <hi>Gregory the ſeuenth</hi> cauſed not only bloody warres to be ſtirred vp againſt the Emperor, but tormented, and murdred ſuch, as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Rome. Alexander the ſixth</hi> for euery word put men to death. <hi>Iulius the ſecond</hi> promiſed reward to him, that could kill a Frenchman, <hi>as Budaeus de Aſſe teſtifieth.</hi> but as <hi>Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> ſaith maſſacring and piety cannot ſtand together. <hi>longè diuerſa ſunt carni ficina &amp; pietas, nec poteſt aut veritas cum vi, aut iuſtitia cum crudelitate coniungi.</hi>

               <p>The ſeuenth commandement as it forbiddeth adultery, fornication, Iuſt, and all vncleaneneſſe; ſo it requireth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of life, and chaſte and vndefiled behauior. but among Papiſts adultery and fornication is reckened among leſſer ſinnes, as appeareth by the Chapter, <hi>&amp; ſi clerici. de iudicijs.</hi> the Pope permitteth whores in Rome and exacteth tribute of them, as is notoriouſly knowen to the world. the ſame is alſo teſtified by the gloſſe of the conſtitution prouinciall beginning with the word <hi>licet. de concubin. cleric. remouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis.</hi> by <hi>Agrippa de vanit. ſcient. c. de lenocinio.</hi> by <hi>Sanſonino lib. dei gouerni. c. corte de Roma</hi> and diuers others. of late in the caſtle of Wisbich among the Iebuſites and Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts one defended, that <hi>whores were in Rome cum appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batione,</hi> and with as <hi>good authority as any citizen, or as the Pope of Romc.</hi> the Popes and their complices diſallow honeſt

               </p>
               <p>The ninth commandement doth directly forbid falſe witneſſe, and whatſoeuer is vnder that conteined, as lying, detraction, and all leud ſpeeches tending to the hurt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of our neighbour. but the Papiſts, as if lying, ſlander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bearing falſe witneſſe had beene commanded, ſo forge and falſifie ſcriptures, fathers, councels, hiſtories and all good authours, as their expurgatory tables, counterfeit decretall epiſtles, and falſe allegations of baſtard authours and others do teſtifie, and ſhall more at large be declared hereafter. their late books alſo are full of execrable lies and ſlanders againſt <hi>M.

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IIII.</hi> Of the damnable doctrine of Papiſts concerning faith and iuſtification.</head>
               <p>THe Apoſtle teacheth vs, <hi>that the iuſt ſhall liue by faith.</hi> but the Papiſts doe ſo handle the doctrine of faith, that the ſame cannot quicken any, but is like rather to be the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the fall and death of many. firſt they teach that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying faith is nothing elſe, but a firme aſſent to the word of God. but if a firme aſſent to euery word of God do iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, then are Chriſtians iuſtified by beleeuing that there is a Diuell, as well as beleeuing that there is a God, and as well are they iuſtified by beleeuing the curſes of the law, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that grace and mercy is offered them in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> nay as well may the Diuels haue iuſtifying ſaith, as faithfull Chriſtians. for they do giue their aſſent to the word of God, and beleeue, that hee is truth. but theſe are moſt damnable doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> they ſay, that Chriſtians are as well to beleeue the traditions of the church not written, as the holy ſcriptures. the doctors of <hi>Trent</hi> will haue both receiued, with equall affection. the authors of the cenſure of <hi>Colleinſol.</hi> 91. teach Chriſtians to beleeue, not only ſuch things as are reuealed in ſcriptures, but alſo ſuch points as are deliuered from hand to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18506:20"/>hand. but if this be granted, then will it follow, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are as wel to beleeue the Pope, or the Church of Rome, as God himſelfe. and that faith is built vpon mans word, and not onely vpon the word of God. and laſtly that faith is built not only vpon vncertainties, but alſo vpon falſhood. for ſuch are the traditions of the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> many are vncertaine, and ſome very falſe and erroneous; as is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhewed in diuers treatiſes, againſt Romiſh traditions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> they teach, that <hi>faith is a gift and light, by which a man being illuſtrated doth firmly aſſent &amp; adhere to thoſe things, which are reuealed by God, and propoſed to vs by the Church. eſt Dei donum &amp; lumen</hi> ſaith <hi>Caniſius Cathechiſmi c.</hi> 1. <hi>quo il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrat us homo firmiter aſſentitur atque adhaeret ijs, quae vt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur ſunt diuinitus reuelata, &amp; ab Eccleſiae nobis propoſita.</hi> now by the church they vnderſtand the Pope, and church of Rome. but of this it followeth <hi>firſt,</hi> that the Church of Rome hath no faith. for how can a Church propoſe and teach matters to itſelfe? this doth vtterly deſtroy the nature of relations, and therefore I thinke the learned Romaniſts will hardly confeſſe this to be true. it followeth next, that Chriſtians are neither to beleeue in Chriſt, nor to profeſſe the articles of the faith, vnleſſe the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> propoſe them vnto vs. but this is moſt abſurd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious. for we beleeue in God, and not in the Pope, nor in the Church adhering to him. that theſe conſequents are good it is euident, becauſe they no leſſe require that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith be propoſed to vs by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that they be reuealed by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> as well doth <hi>Caniſius</hi> require, that Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that the whole body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be contained in the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, as Papiſts do hold it, as the article of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the creation of the world, and <hi>Chriſtes</hi> incarnation. for all theſe articles he ioineth together <hi>Catech. c.</hi> 1. §. 4. but hee could not ſay worſe, if he meant to ouerthrow the whole Chriſtian faith. for the Popiſh real preſence of Chriſts body &amp; bloud in the ſacrament is contrary to Chriſts meaning, to words of ſcriptures, expoſition of fathers, the nature of ſacraments,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18506:21"/>and to humane reaſon and fenſe, as at large is iuſtified in my bookes <hi>de miſſa</hi> againſt <hi>Bellarmine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi> they teach, that the wicked and reprobate, nay that the diuels of hell may haue true faith. but our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith Iohn 3. that <hi>whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> ſo it followeth by the doctrine of Papiſts, that the reprobate, and the diuels of hell may be ſaued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly</hi> they affirme, that <hi>charity is the forme of faith.</hi> but the Apoſtle teacheth vs, that the iuſt doe liue by faith; of which it followeth that faith hath a forme of it ſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it quickneth vs. furthermore it is an abſurd thing to make one vertue or habit the forme of another. and if this were tolerable, that one qualitie were the forme of another, yet would it ſeeme farre more probable, that faith ſhould be the forme and life of charity and workes, for that without faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God, than that charity ſhould be the forme of faith, which doth follow of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuenthly</hi> the Iebuſites of <hi>Collein fol.</hi> 122. teach <hi>that faith is onelie of generall propoſitions, and hope of particulars.</hi> ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of their doctrine, that no Chriſtian ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that he or any other particular perſon hath his ſinnes forgiuen, or is of the body of the church, or ſhall be ſaued. but if this were true, then do not the Iebuſites beleeue, that themſelues ſhall riſe againe, or appeare in iudgement. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then can they not beleeue that Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> or <hi>Leo,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> is the head of the church, or that they are to ſubiect themſelues vnto him, or that this particular Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church, and ſuch other particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly</hi> they teach, that we are not iuſtified by the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, or by imputation of <hi>Chriſts</hi> righteouſneſſe. but the Apoſtle 1. Cor. 1. ſheweth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made to vs <hi>iuſtice, wiſedome, ſanctification</hi> and <hi>redemption.</hi> and that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> beleeuing it was imputed to him for righteouſneſſe. the Prophet <hi>Iſaias cap.</hi> 53. ſheweth that <hi>by his ſtripes wee are healed.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>THe preaching of the Goſpell to Chriſtians is the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome declaration of Gods fauour offred to vs through <hi>Christ Ieſus.</hi> and therefore the Angell <hi>Luc.</hi> 2. ſpeaking of the Sauiour of the world, declared, that <hi>he brought them ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of great ioy that ſhould be to all people.</hi> but the Papiſts by their new and ſtrange doctrine do ſo confound the law and the goſpell, as if they ſought to depriue Chriſtians of this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18506:22"/>ioy, and meant to alter the title of <hi>Christs</hi> moſt ioifull Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell. for <hi>firſt,</hi> as if <hi>Christ</hi> had not beene a Sauiour, or a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, but a lawgiuer, that was to propound a new law, wherewith Chriſtians were to bee newly charged, they call the Goſpell the new law. but neither is the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> contained in the two tables aboliſhed, nor was it Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſurcharge his people with new lawes and new bonds, but to free them from the curſe of the law, and to redeeme them. as for the orders concerning ſacraments we may not repute them to be properly lawes, but meanes and directions for the right applying of Gods graces vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. further the new law that God ſpeaketh of was written in mens harts, as wee read <hi>Hierem.</hi> 31. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. but the lawes of the new Teſtament, which the Papiſts ſpeake of, are partly written in ſcriptures, and partly in decretales. the Papiſts therefore making <hi>Christ</hi> a new lawgiuer doe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his couenant of grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> this new Law or Teſtament, as they ſay, <hi>is the loue of God ſhed into our hartes.</hi> for ſo doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teach <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de verb. dei. c.</hi> 3. but grant this, and then the new teſtament doth not include remiſſion of ſinnes. for loue is one thing, and remiſſion of ſinnes another. but that the new teſtament doth include remiſſion of ſinnes, firſt our Sauior doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, where he calleth the cup of thankeſgiuing, <hi>the cup of the new teſtament for remiſſion of ſinnes;</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome in</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and <hi>Theodoret, Oecumenius,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> vpon the ſame place directly affirme.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the cenſurers of <hi>Collein fol.</hi> 204. ſay, <hi>that this is the

Pelag.</hi> oppoſing the law to the Goſpell, ſheweth that the foundation of workes is laid on the law, but that the building of faith and grace is laid vpon the ſame in the Goſpell. <hi>Theophylact. in praefat. Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</hi> ſheweth vs, <hi>that the Goſpell doth declare to vs good things, as remiſſion of ſinnes &amp;c. and that we obteine them without our labour.</hi> ſinally herein the Papiſts diſſent from their maſter <hi>Peter Lombard ſent</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 40. for he ſaith, the decalogue is <hi>a killing letter,</hi> but the decalogue requireth performance of all things commanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, Peter Lombard</hi> ſaith, that only earthly things were promiſed in the old teſtament, and only heauenly things in the new, as we read <hi>ſent.</hi> 3. <hi>d.</hi> 40. but our Sauior Chriſt teacheth vs to aske for our daily ſuſtenance in the Goſpell. and to thoſe that performed Gods eternall law, eternall life was promiſed in the old teſtament. or elſe the reward had not beene correſpondent to the worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> they teach generally, that there are three euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Counſels, to wit, of <hi>chaſtitie, pouertie, and obedience.</hi> as if theſe were the principall points of the Goſpell, or as if the obedience to monkiſh rules, and forſwearing of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and giuing all to monkes were required of vs in the Goſpell. further it is abſurd to thinke, that chaſtity, and renouncing all for Gods ſake, and perfect obedience is not commanded in the law of God.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:18506:23"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuenthly</hi> the Friers purpoſing to ouerthrow <hi>Chriſts</hi> Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, about the yeare of our Lord 1256. publiſhed another new Goſpell, which they called <hi>Euangelium aeternum.</hi> as if <hi>Chriſts</hi> Goſpell ſhould continue but for a time, and their Goſpell were to continue for euer. Of this Goſpell thus writeth <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> in his collection for that yeare. <hi>Fratres noita quaedam praedicabant, legebant, &amp; docebant deliramenta ex libris Ioachimi abbatis, incipitque eorum liber, Euangelium aeternum &amp;c.</hi> that is <hi>the Friers did preach, read &amp; teach certaine new fooleries out of the bookes of abbot Ioachim, and their booke began thus, The eternall Goſpell.</hi> ſo it appeareth what reſpect theſe fellowes Faue of the Goſpell of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nay albeit the booke was moſt blaſphemous; yet did not the Pope pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the authors, but onely commanded the ſame to bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed ſecretly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> all the comfort, that the Papiſts giue their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers out of the Goſpell is this, <hi>that Chriſt is the meritorious cauſe of our ſaluation,</hi> but the reſt they aſſigne to mens owne labours and workes, teaching them how to merit heauen by giuing to Monkes, and putting on Friers coules, and how they are to goe on pilgrimage, and to buy indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and how to paſſe through Purgatory. and this is the Goſpell of Papiſts. of ſaith they talke only as of a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to iuſtification, and little do they truſt in Chriſts mercy, flying to Angels, to our Lady, and Saints: and to Chriſts iuſtice, remitting our ſins, and accepting vs freely through faith in him, they giue nothing.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly Peter Lombard lib.</hi> 3. <hi>ſent.</hi> 10. <hi>diſt.</hi> teacheth that <hi>Chriſt as he is man, is not any thing, but in reſpect of the vnitie of the perſon. quidam dicunt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Chriſtum ſecundum homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem non eſſe perſonam, nec aliquid, niſi forte ſecundum ſit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſiuum vnitatis perſonae.</hi> and this opinion he alloweth, and would haue the diſtinction to be remembred. but all Chriſtians that profeſſe the faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and rehearſe the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> confeſſe, that he is not only ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as man, but alſo a perfect man. they alſo know, that the opinion of the maſter of ſchoolemen followed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ouerthroweth <hi>Chriſts</hi> humanity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they take from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both faith and hope, and all vpon their vaine conceit, that Chriſt was not <hi>viator,</hi> but <hi>comprehenſor,</hi> that is, was not in the way, but alwaies as man was glorified and enioyed the viſion of the God-head. in <hi>Chriſto non fuit ſides</hi> ſaith <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> 3. <hi>p. q.</hi> 7. <hi>art.</hi> 4. <hi>ergo nec ſpes;</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt had neither faith nor hope.</hi> he ſpeaketh of Chriſt according to his humane nature. and this opinion is commonly followed of others. ſo that which they falſelie obiected to <hi>Caluin,</hi> concerning the vttering of certain words of deſperation, that doth rightly fall vpon the Papiſts, who blaſphemouſly make him not only a deſperate man without hope, but alſo an infidell without faith.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the maſter of ſentences <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>diſt.</hi> 1. determineth, that the Father and the holy Ghoſt might haue beene made man, and yet may. <hi>ſicut filius homo factus eſt, ita puter vel ſpiritus ſanctus potuit, &amp; poteſt. as the ſonne was made man, ſo likewiſe the father and holy ghoſt might and yet may.</hi> which is not farre from the hereſie of the Patripaſſians. for they held that the father did ſuffer death for vs: theſe holde that he might haue taken our nature vpon him, and haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death for vs.</p>

               <p>Eighthly, the ſcholemen determine, that the ſonne of God might haue aſſumed any other nature beſide that of man. of which it followeth, that as God was made man, ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18506:25"/>he might haue beene made a ſtone, or other creature. which is an opinion moſt blaſphemous, and derogateth from the myſtery of Chriſt his incarnation.</p>
               <p n="9">9 They deny reſolutely, that <hi>Chriſt as man profited in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> but that is contrary to the words of the holy ghoſt, to the doctrine of the fathers and ouerthroweth his humane nature. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his booke <hi>de incarnat. dom. ſacrament. c.</hi> 7. ſaith <hi>that Chriſt did profit in humane vnderſtanding. habet &amp; in Chriſto ſcientia aetates ſuas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian lib. de pudicitia.</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſts wiſedome was diuers according to diuers ages.

               <p>IF it be no ſmall ſinne to take the name of God in vaine, how haynous a ſinne is it to blaſpheme the holy name of God? <hi>all ſinnes compared to blaſphemy</hi> ſaith <hi>Strabus in Iſaiae c.</hi> 18. <hi>may ſeeme light.</hi> ſo grieuous it is, that the ſcriptures ſometime auoid the naming of it, and in liew thereof vſe the word of<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. <hi>1.</hi>

               <p>They teach, that the body of <hi>Chriſt is in the Sacrament blood, fleſh, and bone,</hi> and call it their <hi>Lord and God,</hi> and yet like Canibals, they cate and ſwallow downe their Lord and God, and make no bones of it.</p>
               <p>Blaſphemouſly alſo they affirme, that a dogge or a hogge eating a conſecrated hoſte, doth eat Chriſts true bodie. <hi>If a dogge or hogge,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth, as we read in <hi>Beno Cardinalis,</hi> conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this God of paſte; &amp; when he could receiue no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere threw him into the fire. <hi>Ioannes Portuenſis,</hi> as he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, diſcloſed the matter. <hi>tale quid fecit Hildebrandus, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de deberemus viut incendi,</hi> ſaith he. this fact, ſaith <hi>Beno,</hi> was, <hi>that he threw the ſacrament of the lords body into the fire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could receiue no anſwere of it againſt the emperor.</p>

                  <hi>Pius</hi> the fiſt caſt one <hi>agnus Dei</hi> into the water of <hi>Tiber,</hi> another into the fire, as ſaith <hi>Hierome Catena in Pius his life.

               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixth in the chapter <hi>vnigenitus ext. com. de poenit. &amp; remiſſ.</hi> maketh the Romaniſtes thus to cry to the Pope, <hi>domine aperi eis theſanrum tuum fontem aquae viue.</hi> Lord open to them thy treaſure, the <hi>founteine of liuing water.</hi> as if the Pope had with him a treaſure of graces, and as if his indulgences were the water of life.

               </p>
               <p>The honour of God they aſcribe to the Virgin Marie, and to Saints. Confeſſing their ſinnes they ioyne <hi>Mary</hi> with God, and leaue out Chriſt, ſaying <hi>conſiteor deo omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti B. Mariae ſemper virgini &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Likewiſe in a certaine prouinciall conſtitution beginning <hi>authoritate dei omnipotentis de ſent. exc.</hi> they pronounce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication by the authority of God and our lady, and vouchfaſe not once to name <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt the breakers of their lawes they denounce the anger of Peter and Paul, as appeareth commonly in late

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bernardinus</hi> likewiſe in <hi>Mariali</hi> doth ſay, that all graces come downe from God by <hi>Mary,</hi> as <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>vigor</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the head to the other members of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> or rather ſome wicked falſary vnder his name, hath transformed the praiſes and honor of God ſet out by the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commonly they giue power to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ouer her ſonne. <hi>iure matris,</hi> ſaie they, <hi>impera redemptori.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Roman Breuiary</hi> ſhe is called <hi>dulcis amica dei, and the happie gate of heauen,</hi> and to her they pray, <hi>to haue their bands looſed.</hi> In the miſſal of Sarum they pray thus, <hi>per te ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboleri filiorum ſlagitamus crimina, noſque omnes introduci inſempiterna paradiſi gaudia,</hi> as if ſhe were the ſauiour of the world.</p>
               <p>The miſſals and breuiaries are full of impieties. for beſide the confeſſion of ſinnes made iointly to Angels and Saints with God, firſt they offer the Maſſe-cake, as they ſay; <hi>for the redemption of their ſoules, pro redemptione animarum ſuarum.</hi> ſecondly, they make the Prieſt a mediator to God for the body and bloud of Chriſt, as if by his praiers God did accept his owne and onely begotten ſonne. <hi>ſupraquae propitio ac ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reno vultu reſpicere digneris,</hi> ſay the Maſſe-prieſts ſpeaking of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:18506:44"/>Chriſts body and bloud. thirdly, they compare Chriſt to brute beaſts, and the ſacrifice of Chriſts body and bloud to the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> that offered brute beaſts. <hi>digneris accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta habere,</hi> ſaie they, <hi>ſicut accepta habere dignatus es mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera pueri tui iuſti Abel.</hi> fourthlie they deſire God that Angels maie carie Chriſtes bodie into Heauen. fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they make God oftentimes a mediatour or interceſſor to Saints, as appeareth by this praier, <hi>praeſta quaeſumus, vt quem doctorem vitae habuimus in terris, interceſſore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habere me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reamur in coelis.</hi> the ſame is alſo proued, for that Saints know nothing done in earth, as ſome of them ſuppoſe, vnleſſe it pleaſe God to reucale matters vnto them; which if he do, then is God a mediator betwixt the Papiſts and Saints. ſixthly they pray to the croſſe for <hi>increaſe of iuſtice, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for ſinne, augepijs iuſtitiam, reiſ<expan>

               <p>To the images of the croſſe and crucifixe, they giue as much honour as they giue to God. they giue the ſame alſo to the images of the Trinity, teaching their followers, that it is but one honour, that is giuen to the image &amp; the thing repreſented by the image. but the things being two, and that ſo different, as there is no proportion betwixt them, they muſt needs blaſpheme giuing the name and honour of God to theſe baſe creatures</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> That Popery is a ſinke of heatheniſh idolatry.</head>
               <p>OF this argument I haue ſpoken at large in my laſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge. much therefore I ſhall not need to ſay in this briefe ſuruey. yet for that we perceiue, that by the ſecret and cunning practiſe of the Diuell, the idolatrie of the heathen nations, ouerthrowen by the preaching of the Goſpell, is brought backe againe vnder colour of Chriſtianity, briefly we are to ſay ſomwhat of the former argument. It may pleaſe God percaſe to open the eies of ſome Papiſts, and to worke a deteſtation in them of popery, if they may ſee, that as a ſink it hath together with hereſie receiued into it ſelf moſt groſſe and heatheniſh idolatrie. but this is prooued firſt by theſe words of the law <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>thou ſhalt haue no other Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> for this being directed principally againſt the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh worſhip of more Gods than one, certaine it is, that whoſoeuer doth worſhip more Gods than one, or giueth the honour of God to creatures, is an idolater. but this fault is diuerſly incurred by the Papiſts. for firſt they call the Pope their Lord and God, <hi>in gloſſ. in c. cum inter. extrau. Ioan.</hi> 22. <hi>de verb. ſignific.</hi> and both <hi>Felm, and Baldus,</hi> as I ſhewed in the laſt chapter, doe call him <hi>a God on the earth.</hi> abſolutely alſo he is called God in the chap. <hi>ſatis, diſt.</hi> 96. and diuers other places. ſecondly they cal the ſacrament their Lord and God,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18506:47"/>as appeareth by <hi>Allens treatiſe de ſacrſic. euchariſt. c.</hi> 41. and <hi>Briſtow in his</hi> 26. <hi>motiue.</hi> neither will they deny, but they giue vnto it diuine honour, as to God. <hi>thirdly Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de cult. ſanct. c.</hi> 9. doth call <hi>Saints Gods by participation.</hi> but whoſoeuer is God by participation, hee is abſolutely God. for the deity is not communicable to any creature. <hi>laſtly</hi> to the ſacrament, and to the croſſe they giue diuine honor ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the croſſe, <hi>ô crux, aue ſpes vnica,</hi> and falling downe like beaſts before the pixe. they doe alſo make vowes to Saints, ſweare by Saints, and confeſſe their ſinnes iointly to them, and to God. therefore plainly are they idolaters. for theſe are honours not due to any but to God, as at large I haue ſhewed in my treatiſe againſt <hi>Bellarmines</hi> diſputes <hi>de culiu ſanctorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>ſecond</hi> argument is drawn from the ſecond comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement directed againſt the heatheniſh idolatrie of thoſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which worſhipped God in grauen images. for that forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the making either of grauen image, or likeneſſe to the intent to adore it or worſhip it. but the Papiſts both make ſuch images and pictures, and fall downe before them, and worſhip them. to the croſſe they pray,<note n="a" place="margin">In breuiar.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> we read <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. that God to repreſſe the idolatry of his people told them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that when they heard him ſpeake out of the fire in mount <hi>Horeb, yet they ſaw no likeneſſe of any thing.</hi> do they not then run into this ſin, that make the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and repreſent God the father in the image of an old man, and God the holy ghoſt in the figure of a doue? if this be not idolatry, yet it is certainly idolatry to giue the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18506:47"/>ſame honour to one of theſe images, which they giue to God. neither will they denie, that it is idolatrie to giue Gods honour to creatures. they muſt therefore either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie theſe images to be creatures, or confeſſe themſelues to be idolaters.</p>

               <p>The holy ſcriptures <hi>Amos.</hi> 5. <hi>and Act.</hi> 7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> condemne them for idolaters, that worſhipped and <hi>ſerued the hoſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> but the Papiſts deny not, but that <hi>Dulia</hi> and ſeruice is due to Angels, and Saints, and all the hoſt of heauen, and accordingly they doe them ſeruice in moſt ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> That Popiſh religion neuer came from Hieruſalem.</head>
               <p>TRue Chriſtian religion was firſt preached in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and from thence was deriued throughout all nations vnto the endes of the world. <hi>ye ſhall be witneſſes vnto me</hi> ſaith our ſauior to his Apoſtles <hi>Act.</hi> 1. both in <hi>Hieruſalem, &amp; in all Iudaea, and in Samaria, and to the ends of the world.</hi> and herein was the Propheſie of <hi>Iſay. c.</hi> 2. fulfilled, that told vs long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>how the law ſhould goe foorth out of Zion, and the word of the Lord out of Hieruſalem.</hi> neither neede we inſiſt much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point. for <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his relection of doctrinal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>contr.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 5. confeſſeth ſo much, and euery odde Maſſe-prieſt, that taketh vpon him to handle theſe matters, is ſtill talking of the beginning of religion at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> but little wot they poore ſoules how little aduantage this bringeth to their cauſe. for if they be not either impudent or deſperate, they will neuer ſay, that theſe grounds, theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, theſe hereſies and idolatries which before are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, came from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> but ſhould they runne beſide themſelues with fury, yet will they neuer be able to proue their aſſertion.</p>
               <p>To giue them further particular inſtances, gladly would I haue <hi>Kelliſon</hi> the ſurueior, or (becauſe he is bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Petrus Fontidonius</hi> in a Sermon of his in the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> told his audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the two principal pillers of the Roman church were the Maſſe, and the Pope. let vs then ſee, whether any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can ſhew, that theſe two came from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> we haue inuincible reaſons to the contrarie. for <hi>firſt Miſſa</hi> is a Latine word, as <hi>Bellarmine de miſſa,</hi> and the lernedſt of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries confeſſe. but it is not likely that Latine Maſſes ſhould
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18506:50"/>come from <hi>Hieruſalem. ſecondly</hi> the Latine Maſſe doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from that of <hi>S. Iames,</hi> both in the canon, and other parts. <hi>thirdly Gregory</hi> ſaith, the Apoſtles conſecrated, ſaying only the Lords praier. <hi>fourthly</hi> the maſſemonger Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>Celeſtine</hi> made the introit, and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> &amp; <hi>Gregory</hi> other parts: which were no biſhops of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> but of <hi>Rome. fifthly</hi> the Eaſterne church to this day defieth the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Maſſe, which it is not like it would haue done, if it had come from <hi>Hieruſalem. ſixthly</hi> there is no probabilitie, that in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> theſe words <hi>&amp; aeterni,</hi> and <hi>myſterium fidei</hi> were added in the conſecration of the cup. for Chriſt vſed them not, neither are they Hebrew but Latine. <hi>ſeuenthly</hi> in <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> it was neuer beleeued, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> either did eat vp himſelfe, or offer himſelfe to his father at his laſt ſupper, or that he offered himſelfe twiſe, or that there was any prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt.</hi> for the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> teacheth contrarie. <hi>finally</hi> we neuer read that the Chriſtians in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> beleeued, that ſome Maſſes were wet, ſome dry, ſome in the honor of Angels, ſome in the honour of Saints, ſome in the honor of confeſſors, ſome good for pigges, others for horſes, ſome for quicke, ſome for dead; or that all thoſe trickes and skips are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which the Maſſe-prieſts vſe at the altar; or that Chriſt ordeined either the conſecration of Churches with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet in Greeke; or that Prieſts were to vſe thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which now are frequented in the church of Rome in the celebration of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p>That the Pope came not from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it appeareth <hi>firſt,</hi> for that among al the miniſters of the church deſcribed <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. there is no Pope, nor monarch of the church expreſſed. we read of Apoſtles, Prophets, Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, Paſtors and others: but the Pope is quite forgotten. which is moſt vnlikely, eſpecially conſidering that he is by the Papiſts ſuppoſed to be the head and foundation of the church. <hi>ſecondly</hi> the name is rather <hi>Latine,</hi> then <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or <hi>Syriake.</hi> for ſome deriue it from <hi>papè,</hi> becauſe the Pope is the wonderment of the world. ſome from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſome from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18506:51"/>the 2. ſyllables of <hi>pater patrum. Thirdly</hi> at <hi>Hierisſalem</hi> neuer was there any termed by the name of Chriſts vicars general, or that wore a triple crowne, and had a gard of Switzars at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon him. <hi>fourthly Saint Peter</hi> neuer tooke vpon him to depoſe kings, or to tranſlate kingdomes from one to another, which the Pope now vſurpeth. <hi>fifthly</hi> the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretales and decrees, which conteine the Popes office and authority, and the marrow of his religion, haue proceeded from Rome, and not from <hi>Hieruſalem. ſixthly</hi> we read, that the law of God, and not the Popes lawes came from <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. finally</hi> the faith and doctrine of the Pope for the moſt part hath beene inuented and publiſhed ſince <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> came to bee ſubiect to the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes.</hi> if then it came from the <hi>Turkie Hieruſalem,</hi> it muſt needes be rather Turkiſh, then Chriſtian. the decretales are rather like the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> then the new teſtament. the force that the Pope vſeth againſt Chriſtians proceedeth rather from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> then from <hi>S. Peter.</hi> The pilgrimages to <hi>Rome</hi> are like the pilgrimages to <hi>Mecha.</hi> laſtly both <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Saints, and pray for the dead alike.</p>
               <p>To proceede a little further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Romiſh fine Sacraments added to the Sacrament of baptiſme and the Lords ſupper, had neuer allowance by the Apoſtles remaining at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> for albeit mariage, Prieſthood and repentance were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies practiſed by the people of God vnder the law, yet were they not vſed as Sacraments. neither in theſe matters did either the people of God vnder the law, or the firſt Chriſtians vſe the Popiſh orders and formes or Sacraments now at Rome frequented. in time paſt neither were Prieſts prohibited to marry, nor were there any times limited for mariage, nor was it deemed vnlawfull for goſſips to marry.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> neuer was any ſuch forme of ordering of Prieſts knowen, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> as is vſed in popery, where they ſay receiue power to offer ſacrifice for quicke and dead. Nor did the Chriſtians of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> beleeue, that there were ſeven or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and euery one a Sacrament, and yet but one Sacrament in all, or that Prieſts were to haue ſhauen crownes.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:18506:51"/>
               <p>To thinke, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſinnes euery yeere at the leaſt in the Prieſts care, is moſt abſurd. likewiſe to ſay that the forme of abſolution that is now vſed, was then knowen. <hi>thirdly</hi> Chriſtians then did neither laſh themſelues, nor thinke to ſatisfie for ſinnes by eating ſaltfiſh or going barefoote. <hi>laſtly</hi> they neither belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that Chriſtians were to ſatisfie for their ſinnes in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nor that the Pope caried the keies of purgatory, and could deliuer ſoules from thence by indulgences.</p>
               <p>This forme of Confirmation, <hi>ſigno te ſigno crucis,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 
                  <hi>&amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmo te Chriſmate ſalutis &amp;c.</hi> was by authority firſt eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> vnder <hi>Eugenius the</hi> 4. a <hi>Venetian,</hi> and not by any, that came from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> he alſo ordered that oile and balme ſhould be the matter of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> and <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> affirme, that Confirmation was inſtituted at <hi>Melda.</hi> popiſh confirmation is far degenerated from that Confirmation that was vſed in the primitiue church, and which we retaine in England.</p>
               <p>The forme alſo &amp; matter of extreme vnction was there appointed by <hi>Eugenius.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the doctrine of the <hi>character,</hi> and effectes of extreme vnction are not to be found, but in the frapling ſchoolemen.</p>
               <p>Now he that ſhould ſeeke for the originall of holy water, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> and holy ſalt, and holy candles at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he ſhould but ſeeke to draw water out of a flint, and as well might he light a candle in the ſea water. in the Roman miſſal we find theſe words, <hi>I exorciſe or coniure thee thou creature of water,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcizo te creatura ſalis,</hi> and ſuch like. but <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſhould ſhew theſe things out of ſome Hebrew or Syriake miſſal.</p>
               <p>The eating of Paſchal lambes, I confeſſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> was vſed at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem:</hi> but not by Chriſtians, but by Iewes, obſeruing the ceremonies of <hi>Moyſes</hi> his law.</p>
               <p>The Romiſh miſſals, breuiaries, our ladies Pſalters, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> the roſaries and ſuch like bookes and ceremonies came out of the cloſet of the Popes breaſt, and not from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as I thinke our aduerſaries will confeſſe, if they bee put to the queſtion.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:18506:52"/>
               <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> vpon good Friday they make <hi>agnus Dei,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wax, and holy chriſme, and theſe, they ſay, <hi>do defend Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from lightning and tempeſt. hiagnia fulgure &amp; tempeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te fideles &amp; credentes defendunt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Durand. rational. diumor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 79. but this ceremony came neuer from <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> neither did the Chriſtians there beleeue anie ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>When a church is conſecrated the biſhop ſprinkleth the wals with holy water, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> knocketh at the dore, and ſaith, <hi>attollite principes portas veſtras.</hi> then he maketh croſſes on the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſcribeth all the Greeke and Latin alphabet, as <hi>Durand</hi> ſheweth <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>rat. diuin. c.</hi> 6. but if popery had come from <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> it is more likely, hee ſhould deſcribe the Hebrew alphabet. ſuch abuſes of ſcripture and fooliſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, certes, neuer came from the Chriſtians of <hi>Hicruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but from the followers of Antichriſt at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> maketh the old Latin vulgar tranſlation authenticall. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> but if the ſame had hoped to proue the Romiſh religion by the practiſe of the Church of <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> the ſame would neuer haue neglected the Hebrew text.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> diligently obſerued Gods commandement concerning the making and worſhipping of granen images, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and the whole worſhip of God. we may not therefore thinke, that either the Chriſtians there made the images of God the father, and the holy ghoſt, or elſe worſhipped and burnt incenſe to them: and very abſurd it were, if any man ſhould ſuppoſe, that the Popiſh inuocation and worſhip of Saints and Angels is to be proued by their practiſe. <hi>Philo in legat. ad Caium</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Iewes thought it impious, either in picture, or grauen worke to repreſent God, that is inuiſible. inuiſibilem Deum pingere aut ſingere nefas duxe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt maiores noſtri,</hi> ſaith he. neither if we runne through the Bible ſhall wee find any precedent of the popiſh inuocation and worſhip of Saints vſed in the Romiſh church.</p>
               <p>Finally if the Church of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had knowen or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> that S. <hi>Peter</hi> or his ſucceſſors had been deſigned Chriſts

               </p>
               <p>The Pope and his complices therefore muſt ſeeke ſome other place, than <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> whence to deriue their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, lawes, ceremonies, and formes of gouernment, or elſe they will neuer find out the true deſcent of their church.

               </p>
               <p>The holy Prophets brought no meſſage to thoſe nations, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to whom they were ſent, but they confirmed the ſame by the teſtimony of God, that ſent them, ſaying, <hi>thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> and <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> but the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi>

               <p>THe Popes Agents, when they are vpon their owne dunghils, and among their owne diſciples and fauorers, doe make great crackes, as if the Popiſh religion, which is now taught at Rome, were the only religion profeſſed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient kings, princes and emperors of Rome, that made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian faith. but who ſo liſt to read the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient confeſſions of Chriſtian kings, and the lawes made

               <p>The firſt Chriſtian king of Britaine, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> if we may beleeue <hi>Bede,</hi> and others of latter times (for in more auncient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there is no record of ſuch a king or ſuch matters, as then paſſed) was <hi>Lucius.</hi> but we doe not finde, that the Popiſh Maſſe was then hatched. or that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> pretended the vniuerſall monarchy of the Church. nay wee read, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth make as great account of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as of <hi>Rome,</hi> albeit the ſame be firſt placed in regard of the ſplendour and authority of that citie. furthermore <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> neither had images nor worſhipped them, nor did he giue <hi>Latria</hi> to the croſſe. of Purgat one and indulgences he could not heare any thing, for that <hi>Eleutherius</hi> as yet tooke not vpon him to deliuer ſoules out of Purgatory, nor to grant pardons <hi>a poena &amp; culpa.</hi> finally if <hi>Kelliſon</hi> ſeeke to prooue the articles of Popery before mentioned by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Lucius;</hi> you ſhall ſoone ſee, that the man will be at a ſtand.</p>
               <p>The firſt Chriſtian Emperour of Rome was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but many actes of his declare, that he was neither a ſlaue of the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor a profeſſor of Popery. for firſt by his authority both was the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and the actes thereof eſtabliſhed, as <hi>Enſchius in vita Conſtantini,</hi> and other eccleſiaſticall writers doe teſtifie. <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> that faith, which the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> publiſhed, he profeſſed. but therein is not one article of Popery eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but rather diuers refuted, as namely the doctrine of Papiſts concerning Chriſts humanitie, and the Popiſh reall preſence, and diſſoluing prieſts mariages. for if Chriſt be true man, then is not his body inuiſible and impalpable in the Sacrament. againe if Chriſts body be aſcended into heauen, then is not the ſame in euery pixe. if the ſame be to come from heauen, then is not the ſame to creepe out of a pixe. if mariage of Prieſts be honorable, and not to be diſſolued, as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18506:55"/>was decreed in the counceil of <hi>Nice</hi> by the aduice of <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius:</hi> then doe the Papiſts teach doctrines of diuels, that condemne ſuch mariages, and ſeparate Prieſts from their wiues. <hi>thirdly</hi> all the actes of that councell were confirmed, and not only receiued by <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> but that ſheweth that the Biſhop of Rome then had no more authoritie in his prouince, then the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in his, as the ſixth canon of the <hi>Nicene</hi> councell teſtifieth. <hi>the</hi> 4. <hi>canon</hi> ſheweth that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no greater authority in ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning biſhops, then other metropolitans. the fifth canon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualleth his power in excommunication to that, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhops had. to abridge this matter, we finde, that the Biſhops of Rome. were as well ſubiect to the canons of the councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> as other Biſhops. finally we finde, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made lawes for church gouernment in his time, and not the Biſhops of Rome. Nay the biſhops of Rome, as is ſaid in the counterfet donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had their priuileges from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and not contrariwiſe. <hi>priuilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Romanae eccleſiae pontifici contulit,</hi> ſaith the author of that donation, <hi>vt in toto orbe Romani pontifices vel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Likewiſe we read, that the councels of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were called by the authority of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and that their acts and decrees were ratified by them, and not by the biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> more than other biſhops, as is pretended.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18506:56"/>of Chriſts body in the ſacrament, and tranſubſtantiation. for if Chriſt haue a true body, that is circumſcriptible &amp; ſolide, then is not Chriſts body really in euery conſecrated hoſt. and if that, according as after the vnion of the natures both remaine, ſo the bread and wine remaine after conſecration, as the fathers of that councell pretend; then awaie flieth the fancy of popiſh tranſubſtantiation.</p>

               <p>Before the conuenticle of <hi>Laterane</hi> Chriſtian kings and princes knew now what tranſubſtantiation ment. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> neither did they receiue the doctrine of the communion vnder one kinde before the ſynode at <hi>Conſtance.</hi> in the conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> vnder <hi>Eugenues</hi> the 4. the doctrine of the ſeuen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, of Purgatorie, of the Popes ſupremacie began to be in more reputution. the reſt of their hereſies the Pope and his complices could not procure to be authorized before the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> and yet the <hi>French</hi> refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the actes of that conuenticle, and the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fift by his agents proteſted againſt them. the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> king of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> and manie other States reſolutely reiected and contemned them.</p>
               <p>So we ſee that the doctrine of the Romiſh church was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner receiued by many Chriſtian princes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> eſpecially this forme of doctrine, that is preſcribed by the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> the Popes excommunications, prouiſions, rapines, violence and tyranny we finde to haue beene of moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian kings reſiſted. when the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> began to lift vp their heels againſt the Eaſterne Emperors <hi>Leo Iſauricus;</hi> and others, and to excommunicate them; they neglected their cenſures, and in the Eaſterne parts were obeied as before. <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. emperour of Rome draue <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. out of his ſeate, and appointed another in his place. <hi>Henry</hi> the 5. his ſonne tooke <hi>Paſchalis</hi> priſoner, and made him ſweare to

               <p>
                  <hi>LEt that abide in you,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 2. <hi>which you haue heard from the beginning.</hi> ſo likewiſe we ſay, let vs abide in that faith, and let that faith abide in vs, that was firſt preached by the Apoſtles ſchollers and ſucceſſors in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and let vs not be caried away by the poleſhorne crew of the Pope to beleeue popiſh nouelties and fables. that the auncient Chriſtians of this land whether <hi>Britans, Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> were not conuerted to popiſh religion, that is now predominant in the kingdome of antichriſt, we haue three moſt euident demonſtrations to aſſure vs.</p>
               <p>Frſt thoſe doctrines and grounds of Popery, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue mentioned, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will neuer be proued to haue beene taught by the firſt planters of Chriſtian religion in this land. and very abſurd it were to ſuppoſe them to haue beene the authors of thoſe hereſies, impieties and blaſphemies, which are ſo rife in Popery. If <hi>S. Peter</hi> or <hi>S. Paul,</hi> or any of their ſchollers did plant religion heere, we muſt not thinke, that they taught one thing, and wrote another, or that the ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers preached otherwiſe then they had learned from their maſters. If <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea</hi> did firſt conuert the <hi>Britans,</hi> and <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus</hi> confirme them in the faith, or if <hi>Auſten</hi> the Monke and his fellowes did firſt conuert the <hi>Saxons</hi> or <hi>Engliſh;</hi> yet can it not bee ſhewed, that any one of theſe did teach, that the traditions of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> and holy ſcriptures were with equall affection to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or that the doctrine of Popiſh holy water, paſchall lambes, toſaries, images and ſuch like traditions, is the word
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18506:59"/>of God, or that <hi>Chriſts</hi> true body is torne with teeth and receiued downe into the belly, and may be eaten of dogges and hogges, or that Chriſtians are iuſtified by extreme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or eating ſaltfiſh and redherrings vpon fridaies and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting daies, or that incenſe is to be burnt to images, or the Sacrament adored for God, and caried about in proceſſion, or the reſt of the points of Popery before mentioned. either therfore let <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhew vs, that the ſeueral points of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry before touched were taught by <hi>S. Peter</hi> the Apoſtle, and <hi>Eleutherus,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Rome;</hi> or elſe he muſt know, that whatſoeuer he fableth of his <hi>three ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſions,</hi> the ſame will make for the deſtruction of Popery, and the ouerthrow of the cauſe, which he mainteineth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> we are able to prooue, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that all theſe corruptions of doctrine, ſuperſtitious deuiſes, impieties, &amp; blaſphemies, which we refuſe, haue beene receiued and eſtabliſhed in the ſynagogue of Rome, not onely ſince the Apoſtles times, but alſo ſince the time of <hi>Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt. the idolatrous worſhip of images was firſt confirmed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ncell of <hi>Nice</hi> vnder the Empire of <hi>Irene,</hi> and by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little brought into the Weſterne church, being long oppugned by the biſhops of <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the images of the croſſe and <hi>Trinity</hi> ſhould be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped with <hi>latria,</hi> was not allowed in that idolatrous coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but firſt taught by <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and his followers, and grounded not vpon Gods word, but vpon this rule of Philoſophy, that the ſame motion is directed to the image, and the thing imagined. which rule by him is miſtaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meant of the ſpecies or repreſentation of things in our vnderſtanding, and not of materiall images, that come not within our vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Popes authority began to be eſtabliſhed firſt by the rebellion of <hi>Gregory the ſecond,</hi> and <hi>Gregory the third,</hi> that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Italy</hi> to reuolt from the Emperour vnder pretence of worſhip of images. and afterward the ſame was confirmed by <hi>Gregory the ſeuenth</hi> and his ſucceſſors, that by force and violence ouerthrew the empire, and made way by the diuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18506:59"/>of Chriſtendome to the victories and conqueſts of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Saracens. Boniface the third</hi> obteined of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be reputed head of other churches. <hi>Boniface the</hi> 9. <hi>as Theodoric à Niem</hi> in his booke of ſchiſme teſtifieth, by fraude vſurped firſt the temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment ouer the Citie and territorie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that belonged either to the emperor, or to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. and thus by fraud and violence the Pope made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe great, and by little and little exalted himſelfe in the church, and erected the kingdome of Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>The carnall eating and preſence of Chriſts body in the ſacrament was firſt decreed by <hi>Nicolas the ſecond</hi> in the <hi>Chap. ego Berengarius. diſt.</hi> 2. <hi>de conſecrat.</hi> for there we read firſt, <hi>that Chriſts true body is handled with the hands of Prieſts, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and torne with the teeth of the faithfull.</hi> his words preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Berengarius</hi> are, <hi>verum corpus &amp; ſanguinem domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti eſſe &amp; ſenſualiter non ſolum ſacramentum, ſed in veritate manibus ſacerdotum tractari, frangi, &amp; fidelium dentibus atteri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tranſubſtantiation got reputation firſt by the decree of <hi>Innocent the</hi> 3. as we read in the chapter <hi>Firmiter. de ſum. Trin. &amp; fid. cath.</hi> for there he decreeth, <hi>that the bread is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiate into the body, and the wine into blood, by the power of God.</hi> but yet two inconueniences will heere fall out, if we yeeld to his words. for there he ſaith, <hi>that Christ is both the priest and the ſacrifice,</hi> and that this tranſubſtantiation <hi>is wrought by the power of God.</hi> whereof the firſt ouerthroweth the prieſthood of the polſhorne prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> the ſecond doth take away the efficacie from theſe wordes, <hi>hoc est enim corpus meum,</hi> and <hi>hic est ſanguis meus,</hi> and aſcribeth all to the power of God abſolutely.</p>
               <p>In the conuenticle of <hi>Constance</hi> we finde it firſt reſolued, <hi>that the accidents of bread and wine doe remaine without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope is Chriſts immediate vicar.</hi> and <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 13. that although Chriſt did inſtitute the euchariſt in bread and wine, <hi>yet lay-men were onely to receine it vnder one kinde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Auricular confeſſion was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Innocent the</hi> 3.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18506:60"/>
                  <hi>in the chap. omnis vtriuſque ſexus. de poenit. &amp; remiſſ.</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was free to confeſſe, or not to confeſſe. the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of confeſſion was enlarged by the canoniſtes and ſchoole-men.</p>
               <p>In the conuenticle of <hi>Florence</hi> we reade, that the forme of ordring maſſe-prieſtes, of popiſh confirmation and extreme vnction, and of other popiſh ſacraments was then firſt ſetled by law. there alſo Purgatorie and the Popes ſupremacy was firſt enacted by force of law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clement the</hi> 6. in the chapter <hi>vnigenitus. extr. de poenit. &amp; remiſ.</hi> did firſt deuiſe the treaſure of indulgences. <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. and <hi>Sixtus the</hi> 4. ordred the Popiſh Iubiley.</p>
               <p>That the Pope is aboue the Councel, it was firſt decreed in the councel of <hi>Lateran</hi> vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who alſo bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt to thunder out his excommunications againſt <hi>M. Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> gaue finall complement to the Popiſh doctrine of Traditions, of the Latine vulgar tranſlation, of concupiſcence, of formal iuſtification by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and works, of ſeuen ſacraments, of the ſacrifice of the maſſe, of purgatorie and indulgences, of framing the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God the Father and the holy Ghoſt, and the reſt of their hereſies and abuſes. for what before the ſchoolemen had taught vainlie, that began now by the decrees of the Pope and his complices to be eſtabliſhed, and held for law. then alſo the miſſals, breuiaries, offices and other rituall bookes began to be confirmed by the Popes authoritie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it is an eaſie matter to prooue, that the doctrine of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and of the times, wherein <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathaea, Eleutherius</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt liued, is direct contrarie in diuers points to popiſh religion. <hi>S. Peter</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 2. exhorted all Chriſtians <hi>to ſubmit themſelues to kings and gouernors.</hi> but the Pope commandeth ſubiects to rebell and take armes againſt princes, and excommunicateth ſuch as refuſe ſo to doe, as appeareth by the excommunication of <hi>Paul the</hi> 3. againſt king <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. and of <hi>Pius the fift</hi> againſt <hi>Queene Elizabeth:</hi> both which are extant in <hi>Sanders</hi> his libell <hi>de ſchiſmate. S. Peter</hi> 1. <hi>ep.</hi> 1. would haue Chriſtians <hi>to truſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18506:60"/>on gods grace.</hi> the Papiſts teach their diſciples to diſtruſt gods grace, and to doubt of their ſaluation, and to truſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their owne works and merits. he ſaith we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed <hi>with corruptible things,</hi> but <hi>with Chriſtes moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood.</hi> theſe teach, that men are redeemed after a ſort by indulgences, and by the ſatisfaction and merites of Saints, to whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his booke of indulgences doubteth not to giue the title of redeemers. <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorteth <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to deſire the ſincere milke of Gods word, that they may grow thereby.</hi> the papiſtes barre men from hearing Gods word in tongues which they vnderſtand, and ſend them to beleeue the traditions of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the impure traſh of the ſchoolemen, and the Popes decretales. he excludeth the lordſhip of Popes ouer Gods inheritance: theſe falſe teachers enforce it. he exhorteth vs <hi>to make our election ſure:</hi> theſe fellowes teach, that Chriſtians cannot be aſſured of their election or make it ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſeph of Arimathaea</hi> and the godly biſhops, that liued in his time, and diuers hundred yeeres after him, continued, we doubt not, in the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets. and therefore we may not thinke, that they taught, that Chriſt had a bodie inuiſible or inpalpable, or that his body was in heauen and earth at one time, and yet not continued to it ſelfe, or that his ſoule was omnipotent or <hi>omniſcient,</hi> or that Chriſtians were to beleeue that dogges and hogges did eat Chriſts body, and yet that all the communicants, ſaue the Prieſt, were to be excluded from the cup of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, or that Chriſt is onely the meritorious cauſe of our iuſtification and ſaluation, and that formally we are iuſtified and ſaued by our owne workes, or that remiſſion of ſinnes cannot be obtained vnleſſe we come to auricular confeſſion, and haue the Maſſe-prieſts abſolution, or that the Pope by his indulgences out of ſuperfluous merits of Saints is able to deliuer ſoules from purgatory, or other popiſh hereſies and wicked doctrines before mentioned. for theſe doctrines are contrarie to the holy ſcriptures, in which the ſumme of the Apoſtles preaching is conteined.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:18506:61"/>

                  <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 32. doth diſlike the title <hi>of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall biſhop,</hi> and calleth it <hi>ſacrilegious and prophane.</hi> he doth alſo condemne the worſhip of images <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 109. and <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 9. and commendeth <hi>Serenus</hi> the biſhop of <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> for reproouing the adoration of images. neither doth he allow any more than the hiſtoricall vſe of them. that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory which <hi>Gregory</hi> the Dialogiſt ſpeaketh of, differeth much from popiſh purgatory being rather deſigned for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinnes, than for ſatisfaction for temporall paines after the fault remitted. <hi>lib. moral.</hi> 19. <hi>c.</hi> 16. hee ſheweth that the bookes of the <hi>Machabees</hi> are not canonicall ſcriptures. and <hi>lib.</hi> 14. <hi>moral. c.</hi> 32. that Chriſts body is ſolide, and not like a ſpirit, and <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dial. c.</hi> 55. that things aboue in the eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt are vnited to things below, <hi>ſumma imis conſociantur.</hi> of which it followeth, that there is no ſuch preſence, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts imagine, nor any tranſubſtantiation. for if the bodie of Chriſt reſiding aboue be vnited to things below, then is not Chriſts body included within the accidents of the hoſt, nor is the bread and wine aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monke brought with him a croſſe, and the image of our ſauiour in a table, and did ſing litanies, as <hi>Bede</hi> teſtifieth <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hiſt.

                  <hi>ID verius quod prius,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tertullian lib.</hi> 4. <hi>contra Marcionem. that is true that is former, and that is former, that was from the beginning, and that was from the beginning, that came from the Apoſtles. Hierome</hi> alſo <hi>epist.</hi> 65. <hi>ad Pammach. &amp; Ocean,</hi> ſaid to a certaine newly vp-ſtart teacher in his time, <hi>cur profers in medium, quod Petrus &amp; Paulus edere noluerunt? why doſt thou now bring foorth that, which neither Peter nor Paul would euer teach?</hi> if then Popiſh religion were that auncient religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Apoſtles firſt publiſhed; then had the Papiſts cauſe to reioice, but if Popery be nothing els, but cockle, that hath beene by heretikes, and others the diuels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſowen in the Lords field ſince the firſt plantation of the Goſpel, and if the principall points thereof prooue new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes brought in by the Pope and his complices many ages ſince the Apoſtles time, then I hope euery Chriſtian will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the ſame as nouelties, and Papiſts hereafter will bluſh to talke of antiquitie.</p>
               <p>That Popiſh religion is not the auncient religion of the primitiue church, it may be proued, firſt by the grounds of Popery, that are of a later ſtanding; next by the founders and cheeſe authors of this ſect, that are not ancient; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the particular points of Popery, whoſe originall is found in later authors; and laſtly by the repugnance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the doctrine of Popery, and Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>The principall grounds of Popery are the Popes decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the acts of certain late councels, the diſputes of ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and gloſſes and commentaries of the Popes cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and proctors. but the Popes decretales had no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of law before the time of <hi>Gregory the ninth,</hi> who firſt publiſhed them, and authorized them, before his time <hi>Gratian</hi> and others had made diuers rapſodies and collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:18506:67"/>of the Popes decrees, but the canoniſtes themſelues doe not allow them for law. beſide that, not one of the Popes before the time of <hi>Gregory the</hi> 7. who is the firſt that tooke vpon him to giue law to the whole church, and whoſe epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are firſt recorded in the great bullary, took vpon him to publiſh his decretales for lawes, if any decretales be ſet out before his time vnder the names of auncient biſhops of Rome, the ſtile, arguments, ſimplicity, and fooleries contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them bewray them to be counterfet.</p>
               <p>The Popes authority beganne to flouriſh about the times of <hi>Boniface the</hi> 3. who, as <hi>Platina</hi> ſaith, obteined of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour, <hi>that the church of Rome ſhould be called and holden the head of other churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> that authoriſed the Popiſh real preſence of Chriſts body and blood in the Sacrament was celebrated vnder Pope <hi>Nicolas the</hi> 2. ſome 1050. yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt.</hi> the 2. <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> that eſtabliſhed the worſhip of images in ſome ſort, was aſſembled long before vnder the reigne of <hi>Irene;</hi> but the actes of the councell could not bee receiued in the Weſterne church till long after, the councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that decreed tranſubſtantiation, was aſſembled in the times of <hi>Innocentius the</hi> 3. the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that firſt brought in the communion vnder one kind, and the ſubſiſtence of accidents without ſubiect, was ſummoned about the yeare of our Lord 1414, the ſynode of Florence that firſt eſtabliſhed the 7. ſacraments, and beganne to talke of their formes, and confirmed the Popes ſupremacy and Purgatory, publiſhed her decrees about the yeare of our Lord 1439. the actes of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> that made vp a complete body of Popery were confirmed by <hi>Pius the</hi> 4. in the yeare of our Lord 1564. and this is the antiquity of thoſe conuenticles, that doe principallie confirme the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Popery.</p>
               <p>The ſcholemen crept into the church about the yeare of our Lord 1200. the father of them al was <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> that flouriſhed ſome 1140. yeares after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The canoniſts began after the times of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth,

               <p>The chiefe founders of Popery were the Popes by their authority, the Cardinals by their counſeill, the Monkes and Friers by their bookes and preaching, the Maſſe-prieſts by their maſſing and practiſing, the dinel himſelfe by his craft, malice and violence. the Popes authority in eccleſiaſticall canſes was not great before the times of <hi>Boniface the third.</hi> nor in temporall matters before <hi>Gregory the ſeuenth. Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the ninth, as Theodoric à Niem</hi> teſtifieth, by craft entered vpon the temporall inriſdiction of <hi>Rome.</hi> The cardinals were but pariſh prieſts vntill ſuch time, as the Pope of a Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prince. the monkes in the Weſt church are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Benet of Nurſia</hi> that liued about the yeare of our Lord 530. the Friers aroſe out of the bottomleſſe pit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yere of our Lord 1230. their firſt fathers were <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> and <hi>Dominicke.</hi> the laſt brood of Friers flew abroad into the world vnder the leading of <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> a lame ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, <hi>anno Dom.</hi> 1540. the diuell being bound vp for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeere, counting from the time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> began to be looſed againe about the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, and by all fraud to worke in the heads of Popes, Friers, Monkes and Maſſe-prieſts, and with violence to make oppoſition againſt all thoſe, that preached the truth.</p>
               <p>The foundation therefore of Poperie being ſo lately laid, and the chiefe founders thereof beginning to ſtirre ſo long after the times of the Apoſtles, and ancient fathers; it were great ſimplicitie, if we ſhould affirme poperie to be ancient.</p>
               <p>But the ſame doth moſt clearely appeare by the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar doctrines of poperie, which the Popes factours main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt vs. firſt they hold that holy ſcriptures are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and no ſufficient rule of faith. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verbo Dei c,</hi> 12. affirmeth, that <hi>they are onely apart of the rule.</hi> but none but heretickes in ancient time did derogate from ſcriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They teach, that holy ſcriptures and the traditions of the church are to be receiued with equall affection. but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18506:69"/>that was firſt determined in the 4. ſeſſion of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In that wicked conuenticle alſo they firſt determined, that the old Latine vulgar tranſlation of the Bible ſhould be authenticall.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſouereigne iudge of al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies of religion, and the principall interpreter of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is a point taught of late, ſince Friers began to ſteele their faces with a double maske of impudency.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Before the late conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> wee neuer read, but that concupiſcence was ſinne both in the regenerat, and vnregenerat, as being contrary to the law of God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his preface to his relection of doctrinall principles is the firſt man that euer taught, that wee heare God ſpeaking in the Pope, and that the church is founded vpon his authoritie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The firſt that euer called the Pope a God on the earth are the Popes canoniſts. they likewiſe began firſt to call him the head, and ſpouſe of the church, an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall biſhop.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Papiſts of late time only began to prohibit ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be read publickely in vulgar tongues, and to repine at Gods people, that deſire to reade them in thoſe tongues. for the ancient fathers exhort men to reade ſcriptures.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Since <hi>Diocleſians</hi> time wee do not reade of any that burned bookes of ſcriptures beſides Papiſts. neither did any ſince his time hold out his feet to be kiſſed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Of late time Papiſts beleeue no Catholicke church, but that which is ſubiect to the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas in time paſt the Catholicke church was held to bee diſperſed through all nations, and not vniuerſally ſubiected to other head, than <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. The Romiſh church now obſerueth not the old ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apoſtles, as they are commonly called. <hi>ex</hi> 84. <hi>Apoſtolicis canonibus,</hi> ſayth <hi>Medina de ſacror. hom. continent. c.</hi> 105. <hi>quos Clemens Romanus pontifex &amp; eorundem Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum diſcipulus in vnum coegit, vix ſex aut octo Latina Eccleſia

               <p n="12">12. The ancient Chriſtians did neuer confeſſe their ſinnes to the bleſſed virgin, to <hi>S. Michael,</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and other ſaints, as the Romiſh Maſſe-prieſts do.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Of late the Clerke at Maſſe hath taken vpon him to abſolue the Prieſt, and to pray for him: a matter both ſtrange and abſurd.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The confeſſion of the faith ſet out by <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> concerning Romiſh traditions, inſtification by works, the ſeuen ſacraments, the ſacrifice of the maſſe, indulgences and ſuch like points of Popery, was neuer heard of before the time of that wicked Pope.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The Papiſts can not ſhew, that any Chriſtian before of late durſt cut out the ſecond commandement out of the firſt Table, as they haue preſumed to do in their ſhort Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmes. This they did, knowing themſelues to be guilty, in worſhipping images, of the breach thereof.</p>
               <p n="16">16. The decree of <hi>Sixtus the fourth</hi> concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the bleſſed virgin without originall ſinne, is but a late deuice.</p>
               <p n="17">17. It is not long ſince the Papiſts taught, that veniall ſinnes are done away with holy water.</p>
               <p n="18">18. He ſhould be very ſhameleſſe, that would ſay, that Chriſtians in time paſt did whip themſelues either going in proceſſion, or before the crucifix, as now Papiſts doe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to redeeme their ſinnes with their owne blood.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Ancient Chriſtians neuer beleeued, that it was ſinne to tranſgreſſe the Popes lawes, as the reſiſtance of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Aſia</hi> againſt <hi>Victor,</hi> of the churches of Afrike againſt <hi>Sozimus</hi> and other Popes declare.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Of late time friers, eſpecially the Capucins, haue atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues like chimney ſweepers, &amp; burners of houſes.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The rules of monks and friers are diuers from the rules of Chriſtian religion, and can not be elder then the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of monkes and friers.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18506:70"/>
               <p n="22">22. Gregory the ſeuenth, as <hi>Otho Friſingenſis</hi> ſayth, was the firſt that did excommunicate the Emperour, and taught that he had power to aſſoile ſubiects from the others of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Princes.</p>
               <p n="23">23. The vſe of priuate maſſes without communion is but new, as the old ordinall of Rome, that hath no maſſes of that nature declareth. the canons of the Apoſtles forbid Chriſtians to depart before they receiued the communion.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="25">25. Purgatory for ſatisfaction for temporall paines of ſinnes, whoſe guilt before was remitted, was firſt deuiſed by ſchoolemen.</p>
               <p n="26">26. The <hi>Iubiley</hi> among Chriſtians was firſt deuiſed by <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface the eigth.</hi> he alſo decreed firſt, that all temporall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and others vpon paine of damnation muſt bee ſubiect to the Pope.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Popiſh indulgences are but of a late ſtampe, and the ſchoole doctrine thereof much latter, the Papiſts themſelues being as yet not fully reſolued, what to thinke of them.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Clement the ſixth,</hi> firſt deuiſed the treaſure, out of which indulgences are ſuppoſed to be granted, as appeareth by the chap. <hi>vnigenitus. extr. depoenit. &amp; remiſſ.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="30">30. The doctrine of the Popes penitentiarie taxe for diſpatch of pardons for murders, inceſt, ſodomie and all villanies, I thinke, <hi>Kelliſon</hi> will not contend to bee verie ancient.</p>

               <p n="33">33. The ſeparation of maried couples for religion before conſummation of mariage, without conſent of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is both new and wicked.</p>
               <p n="34">34. The popiſh ceremonies vſed in baptiſme are of a late inuention, as for example ſalt, ſpittle, candles and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh exorciſmes.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Of late they haue begun to exorciſe ſalt <hi>in ſalutem credentium, for the ſaluation of the faithfull,</hi> and holy water to caſt our Diuels, and to driue awaie diſcaſes. theſe conſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not found in the old Romiſh ordinals.</p>
               <p n="36">36.

               <p n="38">38. Halfe communions are direct contrary to Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the practiſe of the church; and firſt eſtabliſhed in the conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>

               <p n="39">39. The Maſſe cannot be old, for that <hi>Nauclerus, Platina, Polydore</hi> and others confeſſe is was innented by diuers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors long after the Apoſtles times.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="41">41. In old time the fathers neuer beleeued, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had a body inuiſible and incircumſcriptible, and that might bee in heauen and earth and many places at one time.</p>
               <p n="42">42. The godly biſhops of old time did neither ſwinge the chalice about their head, nor make croſſes about it, when they celebrated the euchariſt.</p>
               <p n="43">43. The ſaying of ſeruice and adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18506:71"/>in tongues not vnderſtood is a fooliſh noueltie.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Now in the Roman Catechiſme they teach, that euery Maſſe-prieſt conſecrating worketh three miracles. but in old time they were neuer taken for ſuch workers of miracles.</p>
               <p n="45">45. The Papiſts after their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> ſay their <hi>aue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and pray to our Lady. which practiſe is neither ancient, nor Apoſtolicall.</p>
               <p n="46">46. The Pſalter of our Lady and her peculiar offices, and Maſſes in honour of Saints will not be iuſtified by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent precedents.</p>

Petrus de Alliaco</hi> alſo in his treatiſe <hi>de refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat. eccleſiae</hi> ſheweth <hi>that many ſuppoſed, that the Popes were negligent in gathering councels, that they might more fully rule at their pleaſure, and vſurpe the right of other churches.</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor alſo of the booke entitled <hi>onus Eccleſiae</hi> doth alledge the ſame reaſon, why councels were ſo ſlowly aſſembled. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience certes teacheth vs, that nothing is more fearefull to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18506:72"/>the Pope, then the name of a lawfull and chriſtian councell, <hi>Gregory the</hi> 12. and <hi>Petrus de Luna,</hi> as <hi>Theodorio à Niem</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, by all meanes delaied the aſſembly of a councel, and <hi>Martin the fifth,</hi> notwithſtanding the decree of the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> for aſſembling councels from euery ten yeares to ten yeares, would no more heare of the matter. of late time <hi>Clement the</hi> 7. reiected the petition of diuers princes requiring a generall councell. and <hi>Paul</hi> the third would not yeeld to haue one, before ſuch time as he had ſo ſetled his affaires, that no man ſhould dare to ſpeake the truth freely, or to touch his authority. Nay albeit <hi>Trent</hi> were no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent place for vs; yet did not <hi>Iulius</hi> the third thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſafe inough there, nor did he reſt vntill ſuch time, as he had remoued the councell to <hi>Bononic.</hi> laſtly whatſoeuer they heere ſpeake magnifically of the councell, yet otherwhere they ſay the Pope is aboue the councell, and that without his confirmation the actes of the councell are of no force. and ſo they bring the authority of councels to a low price.</p>
               <p>But admit the authority of councels to be as great, as the Papiſts would haue them; yet neither doe they eſteeme much of councels, nor doe councels make much for them.</p>
               <p>For the time of aſſembling prouinciall councels we find diners canons. the councell of <hi>Nice c.</hi> 5. decreed, that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniciall conncels ſhould be aſſembled twiſe euery yeare. viſum eſt per ſingulos annos in ſingulis prouincijs bis in anno concilium epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum ſieri.</hi> the like courſe we finde taken in the 20. ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the councell of <hi>Antioch.</hi> but the Pope regardeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The councell of <hi>Conſtance ſeſſ.</hi> 39. <hi>an.</hi> 1417. decreed, that from thence foorth generall councels ſhould be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>vt amodò concilia generalia celebrentur:</hi> and that the firſt ſhould beginne within ſiue yeares after the end of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the ſecond 7. yeares after that, and that ſo from tenne yeares to tenne yeares councels ſhould perpetually be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated. <hi>deinceps de decennio in decennium perpetuò celebrentur.</hi> but the Popes haue made a ſcorne of this decree.</p>
               <p>The cannons of the Apoſtles decree, that a biſhop ſhould be ordeined by two or three biſhops. but the Pope ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18506:73"/>the roome of Biſhops oftentimes with Abbots &amp; tituler biſhops, as is proued by practiſe, &amp; confeſſed in part by <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine.</hi> the ſixth canon excommunicateth biſhops and Prieſts, that vnder pretence of religion put away their wiues. the Maſſe-prieſts ſeparate ſuch violently from their wiues, and forbid men to marie vpon pretence of religious vowes.</p>
               <p>The ninth and tenth canons determine them worthy to be excommunicated, which being preſent at the oblation of the euchariſt doe not communicat. <hi>qui facta oblatione non communicauerint,</hi> and againe, <hi>qui ſacram communionem non percipiunt.</hi> the Papiſts eſteem them that heare maſſe only, good Chriſtians, and doe little regard theſe canons.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenteenth Canon pronounceth him vnworthie, nay vncapable to bee Biſhop or Prieſt, that keepeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine. which is a plaine ſentence againſt moſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh clergie.</p>
               <p>The 28. canon forbiddeth Biſhops and Prieſts to ſtrike Chriſtians offending. but popiſh prelats cut Chriſtian mens throats, albeit they offend not.</p>
               <p>The 36. canon preſcribeth biſhops their limits, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth them to ordeine clerkes out of their iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. but this is not obſerued by the Pope nor his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ordaine certaine Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> and ſend them for <hi>England,</hi> where they haue no iuriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The 83. canon depoſeth him that ſhall vſe reprochfull words againſt the Emperour, or Magiſtrate, <hi>qui imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem aut magiſtratum contumelia affecerit.</hi> yet doe Popes raile vpon Emperours and Magiſtrates, that diſpleaſe them, at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The 84. canon leaueth <hi>Iudith</hi> and <hi>Tobia</hi> &amp; <hi>Wiſedome</hi> out of the catalogue of holy bookes of ſcripture. the conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Trent</hi> reckoneth them in the canon as well as the beſt.</p>
               <p>When diuers in the councell of <hi>Nice</hi> went about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the vſe of wiues to Biſhops Prieſts and Decons, <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi> reſiſted their determination, and the ſynode conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, as <hi>Socrates lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Sozomen. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>hiſt. c.</hi> 22. <hi>Nicephorus lib.</hi> 8. <hi>hiſt. c.</hi> 9. doe teſtifie.</p>

               <p>The councell of <hi>Neocaeſarea can.</hi> 2. condemneth her, that ſhall mary two brethren. yet doe the Papiſts accompt the mariage of Queene <hi>Catherine</hi> to prince <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Henry the</hi> 8.

               <p>TO handle this point fully would require a large volume. but we will onely alleadge a few arguments for proofe of our aſſertion, referring the Reader for the reſt to our lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger diſputes againſt the Papiſts, wherein we challenge them, that in no one point of faith in controuerſie betwixt them and vs they iumpe with the fathers. and that may appeare in a generality firſt, for that in moſt points, and that of greateſt difference they are deſtitute of fathers. as for example where they go about to proue the booke of <hi>Machabees</hi> and others not found in Hebrew, to bee equall to the bookes of the 4. Euangeliſts. that ſcriptures are to bee read publickely in a tongue not vnderſtood of the hearers. that the Latin vulgar tranſlation is more authenticall, than the originall bookes in Hebrew and Greeke. that Chriſts body may be both viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inuiſible at one time, and is in many places alſo at once. that the body and bloud of Chriſt is really and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally conteined and offred for quick and dead in the maſſe. that Chriſtians not conſecrating are to receiue the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion onely vnder one kind. that in purgatory ſoules ſatisfie for temporall paines of ſinnes remitted. that the Pope by diſpenſing the merits of Saints by indulgences is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer ſoules from the paines of purgatory. that charity is the forme of faith, and is that grace, that maketh vs acceptable to God, and diuers other doctrines of that nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly they oftentimes acknowledge the fathers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.

               <p>Thirdly diuers bookes are publiſhed vnder the name of the fathers, that were neuer written by them. as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the decretales that beare the names of the ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome, the canons of the Apoſtles, diuers actes of the <hi>Nicene</hi> councell, of the councell of <hi>Sinueſſa, Neocaeſarea, Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> and diuers others, the commentaries vpon <hi>Iob</hi> ſet out vnder the name of <hi>Origen,</hi> certaine treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Sina,</hi> and of the inuention of <hi>S.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18506:77"/>by them are authenticall before they can ſay, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge fathers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the fathers were not all of one opinion. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome homil.</hi> 18. <hi>in Geneſ. Nyſſenus de creat. hommis c.</hi> 18. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Iouinianum and others ſuppoſe,</hi> that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, neither woman ſhould haue beene ſubiect vnto man, nor ſhould mankind haue beene propagated by mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. but <hi>S. Auguſtine lib.</hi> 14. <hi>de ciuit. dei. c.</hi> 21. <hi>and lib.</hi> 9. <hi>de Geneſ. ad lit. c.</hi> 3. <hi>and Eucherius</hi> and others are of a contrarie opinion. <hi>Hierome in c.</hi> 1. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> and others doe hold, <hi>that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> repented himſelfe of his ſinnes. <hi>Auguſtine in Pſal.</hi> 126. thinketh otherwiſe. concerning the beginning of ſoules, and their eſtate alſo after this life the fathers are diuided. ſome thinke, that after diuorce the party innocent may marry, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thinke contrary. great difference alſo there was in the beginning about the feaſt of Eaſter, the faſt of Saturday, and Lent. theſe therefore that alledge a father or two, where the ſoundeſt and beſt learned thinke otherwiſe, cannot ſay, that fathers make for them.</p>
               <p>Finally, albeit all the fathers ſhould ſpeake againſt the Pope, yet doe not the Papiſts value them at any thing. <hi>ſi to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus mundus ſententiaret contra Papam &amp;c. if all the world ſhould giue ſentence againſt the Pope,</hi> ſaith a canoniſt, <hi>yet are we to ſtand to the Popes determination.</hi> commonly the Papiſts make as light accompt of fathers, as any men, if they ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. <hi>Caictan</hi> in the beginning of his commentaries vpon <hi>Geneſis</hi> ſignifieth, <hi>that he goeth againſt the ſtreame of the doctors in</hi> expounding ſcriptures. The Popes regard them not one ſtraw, if they talke againſt their triple crowne, two ſwords, or glorious and pompous ſtate, as may appeare by the light accompt made of <hi>S. Bernardes</hi> bookes <hi>de conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ad Eugenium.</hi> all of them, if the Pope defineth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, reiect the fathers with great facility. <hi>Bellarmme lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de verb. dei c.</hi> 3. declaring his opinion of the new teſtament departeth from the expoſition of <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret,</hi> and other fathers.</p>
               <p>Generally in the accompt of the bookes of canonicall
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18506:77"/>ſcriptures of the old teſtament, they reiect the teſtimony of <hi>Hierome in prologo Galeato,</hi> of <hi>Ruffine</hi> in the expoſition of the Creede, of the councell of <hi>Laodicea c.</hi> 59. of <hi>Athanaſius in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopſi.</hi> of <hi>Gregory Nazaanzen</hi> in his verſes, of <hi>Epiphanius lib. de ponderib. &amp; menſuris,</hi> and diuers other fathers; and will haue the bookes of <hi>Tobiah, Iudith, Eccleſiaſticus, Wiſdome,</hi> and the <hi>Machabees to bee</hi> of equall authoritie with the law and the Goſpell in deſpight of all the fathers.</p>
               <p>Contrarie alſo to their opinion they preferre the old La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine vulgar tranſlation of the bible before the <hi>Hebrew</hi> text of the old, and the <hi>Greeke</hi> text of the new teſtament, that is, the ſtanding puddles before the cleare fountaines of holie ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>The fathers exhort Chriſtians, the Papiſts dehort them from reading and hearing ſcriptures read in tongues vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Origen homil.</hi> 2. <hi>in Iſaiam</hi> wiſheth, <hi>that all Chriſtians would performe that, which our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh of ſearching ſcriptures. Hierome</hi> writing vpon the <hi>Coloſſ. c.</hi> 3. <hi>heere,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it is ſhewed, that lay-men ought to haue the word of Chriſt, not only ſufficiently, but alſo abundantly, and that they ought to teach and admoniſh one another. Ghryſoſtome</hi> alſo in his 9. <hi>homily in</hi> 1. <hi>ad Corinth. attend,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as many of you, as are ſecular perſons, and gouerne wife and children, how the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth command you alſo to read the ſcriptures aboue all, and that not lightlie and careleſlie, but with great diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Pope ſhould be aboue all councels, it neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the fathers thought. nay all of them haue recourſe in matters of doubt concerning faith, not to the decretales of Popes, but to the determination of generall councels, next after holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>The biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> oftentimes conſulted with learned fathers concerning the interpretation of ſcriptures, and no learned biſhop did in time paſt attribute more to the biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then to other biſhops. the Papiſts therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Pope that is often blind in matters of religion ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme interpreter of ſcriptures, digreſſe from all the fathers, and haue not ſo much ſeuce heerein, as litle children, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18506:78"/>know that blinde-men cannot iudge of colours.</p>
               <p>The conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> determining, that traditions and holy ſcriptures <hi>are with equall affection to be receiued,</hi> digreſſe from all the fathers, that make not traditions, but the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be canonicall, and of ſacred authority.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts, that ſay, that ſcriptures are not authenticall to vs without the determination of the Pope, and Romiſh church are of an opinion contrary to all the fathers, who deriue their authoritie and credit from God, and not from man.</p>

               <p>In his 2. booke <hi>de Purgatorio c.</hi> 1. he reiecteth the opinion of <hi>Ambroſe, Hilary, Lactantius, Hierome</hi> and <hi>Aleuinus,</hi> that teach, that as well good, as bad neede to be purged.</p>
               <p>In the number of 7. Sacraments the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> departeth from the opinion of all the fathers. for not one can be alledged, that ſaith there are iuſt 7.

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> That Popiſh religion was neuer teſtified by the blood of Chriſtian martyrs.</head>
               <p>STrange it were, if the martyrs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould turne from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and teſtifie for Antichriſt. yet becauſe the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of truth doe boaſt of ancient martyrs, and <hi>Briſtow in</hi> his 15. <hi>motiue</hi> doth place <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as ſetters foorth of the Popes glorious kingdome, we are briefly to ſhew, that the teſtification of <hi>Martyrs</hi> maketh nothing for popiſh religion. and that appeareth <hi>firſt,</hi> for that the Papiſts refuſe to bee tried by the doctrine of the Apoſtles, which were principall <hi>Martyrs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> we haue ſhewed, that the principall points of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery were neither taught, nor receiued during the time of the primitiue <hi>Martyrs,</hi> nor many ages after, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points now taught and receiued among Papiſts, were then refuſed as hereſies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> Papiſts adore idols and burne incenſe vnto them. but the ancient <hi>Martyrs</hi> were therefore martyred, &amp; cruelly put to death, becauſe they would not conſent to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of idols, nor burne incenſe to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the practiſes of Papiſts declare, that they are more like to the heathen Emperors, and perſecutors of Chriſtians, then to the ancient martyrs of Chriſts church. for as they maſſacred Chriſtians for maintenance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike faith, ſo do the Popes and their complices maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre all that ſtand for the ſame. as they by ſword and fire ſought to vphold idolatry; ſo doe theſe. as they hated them deadly, which taught the true faith; ſo doe theſe.</p>
               <p>Finally the confeſſion of the faith publiſhed by <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> and that doctrine, which the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18506:80"/>hath of late confirmed, and commanded to be taught and beleeued, is in many points contrarie to the faith of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent martyrs, and in all points of controuerſie betwixt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and vs vtterly vnknowne to them.</p>
               <p>The holy Apoſtles commend ſcriptures, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and ſo doe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent martyrs. but Papiſts accuſe them of inſufficiencie, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, flexibility, and call them <hi>a noſe of waxe,</hi> and <hi>a killing letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ancient martyrs were burned and put to death, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> becauſe they would not deliuer holy ſcriptures to be burnt. the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe burne ſcriptures, and ſuſpect ſuch for heretikes as reade them in vulgar tongues.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and Primitiue martyrs beleeued the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe they came from God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Papiſts will not haue ſcriptures to bee belecued, vnleſſe they be deliuered by the Pope.</p>
               <p>They taught neither hereſie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> nor impiety, nor noueltie. but Popiſh religion, as before is declared, is full of hereſies, impieties, nouelties.</p>
               <p>In ancient time the Biſhops of Rome were martyrs. now thoſe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> that call themſelues their ſucceſſors, doe murder Gods Saints, and make them martyrs.</p>
               <p>Ancient martyrs taught, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> that one God was to bee ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. the Papiſts giue diuine honour to the croſſe and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixe, and call the Sacrament, <hi>their Lord and God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ancient martyrs did breake downe images. now the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts erect them, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> fall downe before them, and worſhip them.</p>
               <p>Finally ancient martyrs neuer beleeued, that either doggs or hogs could eate <hi>Chriſts</hi> body, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> or that the ſame was in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place, where it could neither be felt nor ſeene, or that the ſame was both in heauen, and earth, and euery pixe at one time, or that bread is tranſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiated into <hi>Chriſts</hi> body, or that Chriſtians do with their teeth eate mans fleſh, or with their throats ſwallow mans blood, or that the biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is lord and monarch of the church, or that he can fetch ſouls out of Purgatorie, or that there is a treaſure of Saints me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, out of which indulgences are granted, or that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18506:80"/>are iuſtified by extreme vnction, or eating fiſh, and ſuch like Popiſh deuiſes.</p>
               <p>Neither is it materiall, that theſe holy martyrs are put in Popiſh calenders. for the <hi>Iewes</hi> bragged of their father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and adorned the ſepulchers of the Prophets, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they neither abode in the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the doctrine of the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Further, <hi>Briſtow</hi> telleth vs, <hi>that S.

               <p>Laſtly he talketh of <hi>Fiſher, More,</hi> the <hi>Charterhouſe monks,</hi> and diuers that died in king <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. &amp; the late Queens reigne for the Popes cauſe, and telleth vs, that they were of his religion. but it is firſt denied, that they were martyrs, and next that <hi>Fiſher, and More,</hi> were of the moderne Romiſh religion. the firſt is proued, for that they died for the Pope, and not for <hi>Chriſt. Secondly</hi> they died as traitors, either by open rebellion, or by ouert act oppugning the Princes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. the <hi>ſecond</hi> is euident, for that diuers of them died before the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> which hath now publiſhed a new forme of faith, and decreed many things, which then were not knowen nor beleeued as matters of faith. theſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes therefore are liker the <hi>Martyrian</hi> heretikes, then to Chriſts martyrs. and if they be honored of any, it is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, leaguers, and traitors combined with the Pope, and forrein enemies againſt their Prince and countrie. ſo likewiſe the <hi>Circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cellions</hi> were honored of their conſorts, as martyrs. yet <hi>Auguſtine epiſt.</hi> 58. ſpeaking of them ſaith, <hi>they liued as robbers, and were honored as martyrs. viuebant vt latrones, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norabantur vt martyres.</hi>

               <p>In matters of religion we are diligently to take heede, that we paſſe not beyond the commandements of God, vpon whoſe word only all true religion is founded. <hi>Whatſoeuer I command you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moyſes Deut.</hi> 12. <hi>take heede you doe it. you ſhall put nothing thereto, nor take ought therefrom.</hi> our Sauiour <hi>Christ Matth.</hi> 15. telleth vs, <hi>that they worſhip God in vaine, that teach for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> finally the apoſtle <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. condemneth <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The maſſe, as our aduerſaries themſelues confeſſe, was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at ſeuerall times, and by diuers authors. <hi>Polydore de in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentorib. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 10. ſaith, <hi>S. Peter after conſecration vſed only the Lords prayer,</hi> and that <hi>S. Iames, and S. Baſil did encreaſe the myſteries.</hi> out of <hi>Walaſridus, Platina, Naucler</hi> and others we reade, that <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> made the introit beginning <hi>iudica me deus,</hi> that <hi>Damaſus</hi> added the confeſſion ſaid by the Prieſt, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Antiphona,</hi> and <hi>Kyris eleeſon,</hi> and <hi>Teleſp ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Gloria in excelſis,</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> certaine orayſons or clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of oray ſons, and the praier <hi>te igitur,</hi> and <hi>Syricius com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes.</hi> and ſo we ſee how it was peeced by little and litle.</p>
               <p>In the conſecration of the cuppe they haue added to the words of our Sauiour the words <hi>&amp; aeterni,</hi> and <hi>mysterium fidei. Innocentius c. cum Marthae. de celebrat. miſſar.</hi> ſaith firſt, that <hi>they were added by the Apoſtles, albeit not found in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</hi> as if it were not a ſimple matter to thinke that they did not write, that which they thought ſufficient. he ſaith again,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:18506:81"/>that they are proued out of the words of the Goſpel. but his proofes are ridiculous. for he muſt ſhew that theſe words were vſed, where they are placed: which he doth not ſo much as once endeuor to doe.</p>
               <p>The Maſſes in honour of Saints and Angels are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men, and that very lately. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> as is ſaid, deuiſed the office ſaid on <hi>corpus Chriſti</hi> day. who deuiſed the maſſes and offices ſaid in honour of <hi>S. Francis</hi> and <hi>S. Dominicke</hi> and other late Saints, the Papiſts themſelues doe not know.</p>
               <p>The Pſalter of our Lady, as ſome thinke, was deuiſed by <hi>Bonauenture.</hi> her Offices are of a latter ſtampe. all are meere humane deuiſes without any ground of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>That Prieſts offer <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his father for the ſinnes of quicke and dead, nay for ſicke horſes and pigges, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer neceſſities elſe can be imagined, is a deuiſe of man, and no way to be iuſtified by Chriſts inſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> inſtituting baptiſme ſaid, baptize: and not ſpit, and ſalt, and greaſe, and light candles. he ſaid alſo to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being preſent, <hi>take and eate:</hi> and not gape and gaze. the ceremonies therefore vſed in baptiſme, and in the maſſe by Papiſts proceed not out of Gods word.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a meere humane deuiſe that no Prieſt may ſay Maſſe without water and fire, and is preſcribed, not by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall authority, but by the Pope in the chap. <hi>literas tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as. de celebrat. miſſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The worſhip of the ſacrament, and the cuſtody thereof in a pixe dependeth on the decretale <hi>Sane cum olim. de cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brat. miſſ.</hi> and was firſt brought in, and inuented by <hi>Honori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us the third.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The practiſe of Prieſts in ſaying canonicall houres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from no canon of ſcripture, but from the conſtitution <hi>preſbyter. de celebrat. miſſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ancient time the reliques of martyrs were buried in the ground, and might not be touched. but humane curioſity hath thought it better now to dig them out of the ground, and to place them in the altar, and to worſhip them, and that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18506:82"/>without any inſtruction or direction of holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Popiſh litanies, wherein Papiſts pray to Angels &amp; Saints, and ſometime to thoſe which are no Saints, are diuers from the formes of praiers preſcribed in ſcriptures: and lately brought in by the deuiſe of ſuperſtitious Monkes, Friers, and Maſſe-prieſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benet, Francis, Dominicke</hi> and other authors of feined religions, tooke not their rules from the Goſpel, but thought they could frame a more perfect religion then the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>The Popes triple crowne, guard of Suizzers, croſſed ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and ſuch like deuiſes will hardly be found in the writings of the Apoſtles. <hi>S. Peter</hi> certes neuer wore any ſuch crown, nor had any ſuch guard.</p>
               <p>Where they praie to the croſſe in the breuiarie and ſay, <hi>increaſe righteouſneſſe in the godly, and grant pardon to ſinners,</hi> they doe it of their owne head, and ſhall neuer find any ſuch praier in ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boniface the eight</hi> firſt ordeined the feaſt of the <hi>Iubiley,</hi> and <hi>Clement the fifth</hi> appointed the feaſt of <hi>corpus Chriſti.</hi> but if you aske their warrant, they will ſhew you ſome other authority, than from the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus quartus</hi> ordained the feaſt of our Ladies concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and another Pope of her aſſumption: but both vpon falſe grounds, ſuppoſing that ſhe was conceiued without ſin, and that her bodie was taken vp into heauen. they maintain the ſame alſo by lies and apocryphall fables.</p>
               <p>Finallie it is an eaſie matter to ſhew, that the formes and ſignes of popiſh confirmation, extreme vnction, and other new made ſacraments are preſcribed by Popes and their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, without warrant of holy ſcripture.</p>

               <p>NEither is popery only deſtitute of warrant out of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but alſo directly contrarie in ſome points to holy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18506:82"/>ſcriptures. In the law <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. we are expreſſely forbidden to adde to the law of God, or to take from it. The Papiſts offend both waies. for to the lawes of God they adde the precepts of the Romiſh church and decretales of Popes, and ſay they binde the conſcience. they doe alſo cut out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement concerning the worſhip of images, as their ſhort catechiſmes and primers doe teſtifie, and by falſe interpretations corrupt Gods law.</p>
               <p>In the firſt commandement we are forbidden to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods beſide the God of heauen and earth. but the Maſſe-prieſts, as before is declared, call the ſacrament <hi>their Lord and God,</hi> and honour the Pope as a God on earth, and giue diuine honour to creatures: which is as much as if they ſhould expreſſelie command their followers to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods.</p>
               <p>The law forbiddeth vs to make grauen images and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, to the intent to worſhip them. the Pope comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his followers to make them, and to worſhip them, and burneth ſuch as teach contrary.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle calleth concupiſcence in himſelfe ſinne. the Maſſe-prieſts of <hi>Trent</hi> denie it to bee ſinne in the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour in the fifth of <hi>Iohn</hi> commanded his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſearch the ſcriptures. theſe followers of Antichriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Chriſtians to ſearch the ſcriptures tranſlated into vulgar tongues without licence.</p>
               <p>At his laſt ſupper after the bleſſing he ſaid, <hi>take and eate.</hi> but theſe good fellowes ſay, gape and gaze on the Prieſt ſaying maſſe, and eate not, but rather keepe the ſacrament in the pixe.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <hi>doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> they doe it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Angels and Saints, and obſerue not that forme which hee preſcribed.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles of Chriſt did receiue and eate the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. the falſe Apoſtles of Antichriſt commaund their ſchollers to heaue it, to adore it, and to carrie it about in proceſſion.</p>

               <p>In the conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Popes adherents eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the communion vnder one kind, and where Chriſt ſaid, <hi>drinke yee all of this,</hi> they ſay, drinke not all of this.</p>
               <p>Chriſt taught his Diſciples to pray to his father, and to ſay <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> they teach their Diſciples to praie to our Lady, and to ſay, <hi>mater noſtra,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>mater miſcricordie.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>S. Iohn Apocalypſ.</hi> 22. would haue worſhipped the Angell, he ſaid to him, <hi>ſee thou doe it not.</hi> theſe ſay, ſee thou doe it.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. commandeth him that ſpeaketh in a ſtrange tongue, or that is not vnderſtood <hi>to keepe ſilence in the Church.</hi> he addeth, that praiers in a ſtrange tongue, or without vnderſtanning <hi>are without fruit.</hi> but the Romaniſts contrarie do enioine their Prieſts to reade ſcriptures, and to ſay ſeruice in Latine, which of the vulgar ſort is not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. <hi>Coſter</hi> in his <hi>Enchir c. de precibus latinè recitandis</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he that praieth in Lattin, albeit he vnderſtand not what he praieth, receiueth fruit by his praier. hune tertium fructum (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationis) non minus percipit,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>qui non intellecta àſe lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua precatur, quàm qui verborum intelligentiam aſſequitur.</hi>

               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. ſaith <hi>God ſpake by the Prophets.</hi> and this is to be vnderſtood, when the holy Prophets deliuered ſcriptures to Gods people. <hi>Staple ton de author. eccleſ.</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places denieth, <hi>that God ſpeaketh in ſcriptures.</hi> and his meaning is, that he ſpeaketh in the Pope.</p>
               <p>Both Prophets and Apoſtles teach, <hi>that the iuſt ſhall liue by faith.</hi> but the Maſſe-prieſts ſay faith of it ſelfe is dead, and that the life and forme thereof is charity.</p>
               <p>The Scripture ſaith, it is better to marrie than to burne. the Papiſts teach that it is better to burne with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18506:83"/>luſt then to marrie after the vow made of ſingle life.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. will haue a biſhop choſen, that is the <hi>huſh and of one wiſe.</hi> and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. ſaith, <hi>that mariage is honourable among all.</hi> the Papiſts admit no maried men liuing with their wiues to be biſhops, and count marriage in Prieſts pollution.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>the law is the miniſtration of death,</hi> and <hi>that by the workes of the law no fleſh is iuſtified.</hi> the Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts teach their followers, to ſeeke for life in the law, and by the workes thereof ſay, that all the faithfull are to bee iuſtified.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Boniface</hi> the 4. conſecrated the Church called <hi>Pantheon,</hi> wherein <hi>Cybele,</hi> and all heathen Gods were worſhipped, to our Lady and all Saints, as is teſtified by <hi>Platina, Iohn di Pineda</hi> and others. this ſheweth that the worſhip of Saints is ſucceded in liew of the worſhip of Idols and heathen Gods.</p>

               <p>From them alſo the Papiſts borow the ſcourging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before the croſſe and other images. for before their idoles the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> did lance themſelues. the Prieſts of Cybele did alſo whip themſelues as, <hi>Apuleius</hi> teſtifieth.</p>
               <p>The gentiles did keepe ſecret the myſteries of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18506:89"/>ſo doe the Papiſts likewiſe, vttering the canon of the Maſſe in a low voice, leſt the people ſhould heare it, and reading the ſcriptures in vnknowen and ſtrange languages. and they yeelde this reaſon, leſt holie things ſhould bee caſt to dogges.</p>
               <p>The beſt ground, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> laieth for proofe of the Popes monarchy is, for that the gentiles thought that forme of gouernement beſt. but God in diſpoſing of matters of eccleſiaſticall gouernment boroweth no precedents from the gentiles.</p>

               <p>By Philoſophy alſo the Popes agents proue, that one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be in many places at once, and yet ſill no place. out of holy ſcripture certes they are not able to deriue anie proofe for it.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of Saints is a meere tricke of Gentiliſme. for as the Gentiles had one principall god, and diuers demie and inferior gods, ſo haue the Papiſts. <hi>Ambroſe in chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ad Rom.</hi> ſaith the gentiles vſed the mediation of others to God, <hi>as men vſe to come to princes by tribunes and huſhiers.</hi> ſo likewiſe doe the papiſts. they gaue the honor of God to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>honorem nominis Dei deferunt creaturae.</hi> ſo likewiſe doe Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the worſhip of images is a meere inuention of Pagans. in the book of Wiſdome <hi>c.</hi> 14. they are called <hi>idoles of the nations.</hi> this is plainly declared by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in his treatiſe againſt <hi>idolatry,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian de idolorum vanitate. Ambroſe in Pſal.</hi> 118. <hi>ſer.</hi> 10. ſaith, <hi>gentiles did worſhip wood, becauſe they thought it to be the image of God. gentes lignum ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, quia dei imaginem putant.</hi> ſo likewiſe Papiſts worſhip images, not becauſe of the matter, but becauſe they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the image of God. and in his commentaries vpon the firſt chapter to the Romanes, he ſaith the gentiles <hi>changed the glory of God into the likeneſſe of men, ſo that the forme of a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18506:89"/>corruptible man is by them called God.</hi> and ſo likewiſe Papiſts call the image of God, God; and the image of Chriſt, Chriſt; and change the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeneſſe of man.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the temple of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> is now turned into the church of <hi>S.

Gregory</hi> in his <hi>dialogues lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. ſheweth, that <hi>Benet</hi> in ſtead of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſubſtituted <hi>S.

               <p>The Gentiles did deifie their Emperours and benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and erect temples &amp; altars in their honour. And what doe Papiſts? doe not they canonize their Popes, and do not Popes canonize Saints? and do they not erect temples and altars to Saints? they will not deny it. but <hi>S.

               <p>The whole maſſe alſo of Poperie doth conſiſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary pieces, as I haue ſhewed in the contradictions of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18506:97"/>doctrine of the Maſſe, of purgatory, of indulgences, of the Pope, and diuers other principall points, and haue proued the ſame in treatiſes of that argument.</p>
               <p>For example they ſay the Maſſe is an vnbloudy ſacrifice, and yet teach, that euerie Prieſt doth really offer and drinke <hi>Chriſts</hi> bloud.</p>
               <p>Sometime they ſay the ſacrifice is but one ſacrifice, yet in the canon they ſay <hi>ſacrifices</hi> in the plurall number.</p>
               <p>Sometime they ſay the Prieſt only offereth this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. but in the cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make the people to offer ſacrifices.</p>
               <p>In the canon they pray, that Angels may carry <hi>Christs</hi> body vnto Gods high altar. but all confeſſe, that <hi>Christs</hi> body is in heauen before.</p>
               <p>There alſo they make the Prieſt a mediatour for <hi>Christ.</hi> but where they ſpeake ſoberly, they make Chriſt a mediator both for the Prieſt and others.</p>
               <p>In heauen they ſay Chriſt is viſible and palpable. on the altar they make him inuiſible, and impalpable.</p>
               <p>They ſay the Maſſe is an externall ſacrifice. yet no man euer yet could ſee Chriſts body externally ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>In purgatorie they ſay ſoules ſuffer extreme paines. but in the Maſſe they ſaie they ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>epe in peace.</p>
               <p>They teach, that Chriſtians may performe the law of God perfectly. but they will not grant, that they may liue without ſinne; which is all one.</p>
               <p>Talking of auricular confeſſion they make it neceſſarie. but in the chap. <hi>Petrus doluit.</hi> and <hi>lachrymae. diſt.</hi> 1. <hi>de poenit.</hi> they denie it.</p>
               <p>The Pope calleth himſelfe ſeruant of ſeruants. yet doth he take vpon him as lord of lords.</p>
               <p>Order they ſay is one ſacrament. yet they teach alſo, that there are ſeuen Orders, and euerie one of them a ſacrament: which is as much, as if they ſhould make one ſeuen, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen one.</p>
               <p>The Pope, they ſaie, is head of the Church. but that is as much as if they ſhould teach, that their Church in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio nis headleſſe.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:18506:97"/>
               <p>If then the catholicke faith be one, and thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the faith agree in one; then cannot popery be the true Catholicke faith, that containeth ſo many contradictions.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> That popery is a moſt fooliſh and abſurd religion.</head>
               <p>AS the lawes of God are full of wiſedome, and giue vs a true vnderſtanding; ſo when man of his owne braine vndertaketh to adde vnto his commandements, the ſame in proofe falleth out to be nothing, but vanity and foolery. the ſame wee ſind verified in the additions of the ſuperfluous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Papiſts. for although it haue a ſhew of wiſedome, as the voluntarie worſhip of Angels had, of which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. ſpeaketh; yet compared with the wiſedome of God reuealed in the Goſpell, it is meere foolery.</p>
               <p>For firſt what is more fooliſh, then to forſake the liuing ſprings of holy ſcripture, out of which do ſally waters of life, and to follow after the puddle ſtreams of <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions? of ſcriptures we are aſſured, that they are the word of God. but no man can affirme that of <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions, or the Popes decretales, that either profeſſeth piety, or loueth truth. is it not then ſtrange, that any Chriſtians ſhould bee ſo fooliſh, as to match the word of man with Gods word, and where we haue a certaine rule, to ſeeke for a broken, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, and crooked rule?</p>
               <p>Againe, it is moſt abſurd, not to beleeue the ſcriptures without the Popes warrant. but to ſay that Chriſtians are not to beleeue in God, nor in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> nor to receiue the reſt of the articles of our Creed, vnleſſe the church of <hi>Rome</hi> doe deliuer them vnto vs, is not only a peece of great foolery, but alſo a very high ſtreine of madneſſe. and yet this is the doctrine of Popery. for <hi>Stapleton</hi> ſaith, that the church muſt needes conſigne the ſcriptures vnto vs, and the authoritie of the church both he and others giue to the Pope. likewiſe in their catechiſme the Papiſts ſignifie that faith is of things onely <hi>propoſed to vs by the church.</hi> ſo that if
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18506:98"/>the church propoſe not the articles of faith, we are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, if theſe men teach truth. further this ſheweth the Romiſh church to conſiſt of a packe of infidels. for if the ſame beleeued not without the authority of the church, then did ſhe beleeue nothing of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſeeing the Papiſts acknowledge no other Church, but that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and no church can teach it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Finally this is as much, as if they ſhould ſay, that the law of the Prince is not to be receiued, vnleſſe it be propoſed by the crier, or other ſuch like officer.</p>
               <p>The Maſſe-prieſts of <hi>Trent ſeſſ.</hi> 4. moſt abſurdly prefer the old Latin vulgar tranſlation of the Bible before the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall text. which is as much, as if they ſhould preferre <hi>S. Hierome</hi> and other interpreters before the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and the ſtreames before the fountaines.</p>
               <p>Generally they forbid ſcriptures to bee read publickely in vulgar tongues. but they permit moſt fabulous legends to bee read publickely.</p>
               <p>The holy ſcriptures they will not permit to bee read in vulgar tongues of the multitude without licence. but they are content that any of their followers ſhould reade the Popes decretales, or the miracles of their god of paſte, or the hiſtory of our Lady of <hi>Loreto,</hi> and other ſuch lying legends without licence.</p>
               <p>To ſay that the Pope is the head of the vniuerſall church is meere foolery. for grant that, and it will follow, that the Church is ſometime without head, as in the time of vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the papacy; and ſometime a monſter with two or three heads, as when two or three Popes reigne at once; and ſometime a mad Church, as hauing a mad and franticke head.</p>
               <p>The church they ſay albeit catholicke, yet is alwaies viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. but this being granted, it followeth, that vniuerſall things may be the obiect of ſenſe, and that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> before our times is not the church, becauſe no man can now ſee it.</p>
               <p>They hold alſo, that the true church may alwaies be ſeene
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:18506:98"/>and diſcerned. but this being ſo, how happeneth it, that the Pagan Emperors in time paſt, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> now doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee it, nor diſcerne it? for we may not thinke, that if they knew the church, they would hate it, and perſecute it.</p>
               <p>They beare men in hand, that the Pope deſining out of his chaire cannot erre. but it is as much as if they ſhould ſay, that a blinde man ſitting in a chaire cannot do amiſſe in iudging colours, or that the Pope ſhould be more wiſe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a chaire, then ſtanding in a pulpit, or walking in a hal; ſitting at the table in his chaire, and feeding daintily, then diſputing in ſchooles:</p>
               <p>They call him Chriſtes vicar. yet our Sauiour did neither weare triple crowne, nor thunder out his excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt Gods children, nor perſecute &amp; cut the throates of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>By the right of S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Pope challengeth power to depoſe Princes, and to tranſlate kingdomes. yet it is abſurd to thinke, that <hi>Peter</hi> had any ſuch power.</p>
               <p>They know, that <hi>Peter</hi> was charged to feed Chriſts ſheepe. are they not then abſurd fellowes, that beleeue the Pope to be S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, that neuer feedeth nor teacheth, but rather murdroth and maſſacreth Chriſtians?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> was neuer borne vpon mens ſhoulders, nor did he giue his feete to be kiſſed of his followers, as a fauour. nay when <hi>Cornelius</hi> fell downe at his feete, he willed him to riſe vp, and would not ſuffer himſelfe to be worſhipped. are they not then ſtrange fellowes, that beleeue the Pope to be S. <hi>Peters</hi> heire, who is heaued on mens ſhoulders, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that Princes and all others ſhould kiſſe his feete and worſhip him?</p>
               <p>They permit publicke ſtewes, and forbid honeſt wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke. they diſpence with adulterie and fornication very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily, as appeareth by the chap. <hi>&amp; ſiclerici. de iudicijs,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and burne their prieſts and friers, if they ioyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in honeſt marriage with lawfull wiues. are they not then abſurd fellowes, that make good euill, and euill good?</p>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18506:99"/>then ſtrange teachers, that ſay <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body is in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at once, and that it is in heauen, and in earth, and not in the middle place, nor continued to it ſelfe?</p>
               <p>Reaſon teacheth vs, that accidents haue their being in a ſubiect. but theſe fellowes againſt reaſon ſay they ſubſiſt in the Sacrament without a ſubiect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> abſteined from eating ſuch creatures, as they worſhipped for God. but the Maſſe-prieſts, as men more ſenſeleſſe, then the barbarous heathen nations, haue no ſooner made their God, but they deuoure him. and heereof proceeded ſuch a ſcandale, that <hi>Auerroes</hi> for this onely cauſe pronounced the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion to be the moſt fooliſh and abſurd religion of all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body in heauen, they confeſſe, is to be felt and ſeene. how then commeth it to paſſe, that this bodie being at the ſame time in the Sacrament, as Papiſtes ſay, is neither felt nor ſeene? is not this notorious patcherie?</p>
               <p>They confeſſe alſo, that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body is of a iuſt length, breadth, and thickneſſe. are they not then abſurd fellowes, that beleeue, that ſuch a body can be conteined in a piece of an hoſt no bigger then a counter? and are they in their wits, that teach that one hoſt being conſecrated, <hi>Christes</hi> whole body is there, and that the hoſt being broken, <hi>Chriſts</hi> body is alſo whole in euery peece thereof?</p>
               <p>Are they not alſo impious and abſurd fellowes, that ſay, <hi>that a dogge, a hogge, a mouſe, or a ſparrow,</hi> may cate vp the Sauiour of the world?</p>
               <p>That the ſame man ſhould be both a creature and a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nay a creator of his owne Creator, is an abſurditie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the boundes both of religion and reaſon. and yet this is a peece of Popiſh diuinitie. <hi>Innocentius lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de myſt. miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae. c.</hi> 19. ſayth, <hi>that dayly a creature is made the creator. ita ergo quotidie creatura ſit creator.</hi> and in <hi>Stella Clericorum</hi> we finde theſe words, <hi>Sacerdos eſt creator ſui Creatoris:</hi> that is, a Prieſt is the creator of his creator.</p>

               <p>Nay when they eate his fleſh, they ſuppoſe they drinke his blood by a neceſſarie concomitance, making <hi>Christians</hi> both to cate and drinke with one breath. and in a certeine prouinciall conſtitution, beginning, <hi>ignorantia. de ſumma Trinit.</hi> the Maſſe-prieſts teach their followers, neither to cate, nor to drinke <hi>Chriſtes</hi> body, <hi>but to ſuppe it vp perfectly, tritum modicè ſorbere perfectè.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Chriſtes</hi> blood hath redeemed vs, and ſaued vs, as holie Scriptures teach vs. but the papiſtes ſay, that <hi>Chriſtes</hi> bloud is really in the chalice after conſecration, in which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we reade in ſtories, that both <hi>Victor</hi> the third, and <hi>William</hi> archbiſhop of <hi>Yorke,</hi> that liued in the daies of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius the</hi> 4. was poiſoned.</p>
               <p>In the Sacrament they confeſſe, that wormes may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred, and that the conſecrated wine may be corrupted. is it not then a moſt abſurd peece of doctrine, to hold, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> body and bloud ſhould be in the Sacrament, where vermine is engendred, and which is ſubiect to corruption?</p>
               <p>Is it not alſo extreme folly to abandon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whoſe name we are commanded to pray to the Father; and to pray to God in the name of Saints, which is no where comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but rather forbidden as derogatory to Gods honour?</p>
               <p>In the office of our Ladie at <hi>Matins</hi> in a certeine <hi>antipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> they ſay, <hi>gaude Maria virgo, cunctas haereſes ſola interemiſti in toto mundo.

               <p>They alſo ſay their <hi>Pater noſter</hi> before ſtockes and ſtones. but what is more abſurd, then to pray to thoſe, that cannot heare, and to looke for helpe of them, that cannot helpe themſelues?</p>
               <p>The Maſſe-prieſts in their praiers looking vpon a little woodden crucifixe, ſay, <hi>thou haſt redeemed vs. thou haſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vs to thy Father,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de cultu ſanct. c.</hi> 23. confeſſeth. may we then thinke, that theſe are well in their wits, that make a peece of wood, or mettall, their Sauiour,

               <p>They giue the ſame honor to the ſacrament, and to the croſſe, that is due to God, very abſurdly transferring the glorie of God to creatures. are they not then abſurd wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, that cannot diſtinguiſh betwene God and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? and doe they not very abſurdly deny themſelues to be idolaters?</p>
               <p>Abſurdly alſo they celebrate the feaſt of the croſſe whereon our Sauiour was diſhonored, not celebrating the feaſt of the aſſe, on which he was honored. <hi>Durand rat. diui.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 11. diſputing this matter is much puſſeld about it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The grounds of their religion are very abſurd and fooliſh: for they ſound themſelues vpon the Pope and his decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales; the Pope being oftentimes ſooliſh and ignorant, and his decretales being rude, falſe, and oftentimes ridiculous. <hi>Baldus in c.</hi> 1. <hi>de natur. ſeud.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Pope Celeſtine the ſift was a ſimple fellow. vnum pecus.

               <p>They ſay it is a point of faith, to beleeue, that the Pope is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and head of the church. yet if the Prieſt, that baptiſed the Pope had no intention to baptize him, then he is no member of the church: if he that ordred the Pope had no intention to order him, then is he no prieſt. If he haue no intention to conſecrate, then doth he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrat. ſo all dependeth vpon mens ſecret and vnknowen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
               <p>They confeſſe alſo, that <hi>Chriſts</hi> body is not in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the prieſts haue no intention to conſecrat; of which it followeth, that all Papiſts, for ought they know, are abſurd idolaters.</p>
               <p>Their ceremonies are full of foolerie. firſt in the maſſe the Prieſt abſolueth the clerke, and then the clerke abſolueth the Prieſt, which is all like, as if one mule ſhould ſcratch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. it is abſurd alſo to put the keyes into a boies hand, that is no Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The Prieſt kiſſeth the altar, and praieth for remiſſion of ſinnes <hi>by the merites of Saints whoſe reliques are there contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> ſo a ſtocke kiſſeth a ſtone, and forgetting <hi>Chriſt</hi> praieth for remiſſion of ſins by the merites of Saints, whoſe reliques are ſaid to be there, where there is no reliques at all, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe the bones of dogs, or apes, or other beaſts, for ought the wiſe maſſe-prieſt knoweth.</p>

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18506:101"/>he maketh a low legge worſhipping the worke of his owne hand, and ſaith <hi>aue,</hi> which is as much, as <hi>God ſaue you ſir,</hi> or you are welcome to towne.</p>
               <p>The prieſt is apparrelled like a moriske-dancer, and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth and danceth about the altar like an ape in a chaine. his head is ſhauen and well greaſed, his hands waſhed, but his hart vncleane. and this gallant taketh vpon him, not only to offer <hi>Chriſt</hi> in ſacrfice, but alſo to ſwallow him downe like a pill without chawing.</p>
               <p>The Friers for the moſt part are apparrelled like chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-ſweepers, or burners of houſes, with a hood vpon their head like a bagge of <hi>hippocrace.</hi>

               <p>The Popes when they are firſt choſen doe caſt mony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſaying, <hi>argentum &amp; aurum non eſt mihi,</hi> as is preſcribed <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>caerem.</hi> but moſt vnlike they are to him, whoſe words they abuſe. further, abſurdly they deny themſelues to haue mony, when they caſt mony a broad, and inioy ſo great riches.</p>
               <p>When they take the Pope from the perced ſtoole, where his humanitie is tried, they ſay <hi>he hath rayſed the poore out of the duſt. ex ſtercor ariae eleuantes dicunt, ſuſcitat de puluere ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> and yet abſurdly this beggar, as they ſay, <hi>is lord of lords and King of Kings.</hi>

               <p>They ſay the firſt iuſtice is without workes, the ſecond is of workes. but the holy ſcriptures ſpeake but of one ſort of iuſtice, whereby Chriſtians are to be iuſtified before God.</p>
               <p>They ſpeake ſtrangely of <hi>opus operatum, &amp; opus operans.</hi> but ſcriptures acknowledge no ſuch inkepot termes, nor doctrine.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction of merits of congruity and condignity is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18506:102"/>as abſurd as the reſt. for how can a man that is vnworthy of fauour, be ſaid to merit?</p>
               <p>With the ſprinkling of holy water they thinke to driue away Diuels. but it is moſt abſurd to thinke, that they are ſcarred with water.</p>
               <p>In the church ſeruice they vſe a tongue not vnderſtood. but in the primitiue church, as <hi>Aquin. in</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. confeſſeth, that was counted madneſſe. they pray alſo like parrats, and know not what they ſay: which is fooliſh and fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p>In conſecrating of churches they write the Greek <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet</hi> vpon the pauement. but what is more fooliſh than to teach ſtones the <hi>Alphabet?</hi>

               <p>And when their Diſciples lie a dying, then they put light in their hands, and greaſe their eies. but it is ridiculous to ſhew light to dead men, or to thinke that men can ſee better hauing oile in their eies.</p>
               <p>What then remaineth, but that we beſeech God to open the eies of Papiſts, that they may in the end ſee the fooleries and abſurdities of that ſuperſtitious religion, whereto now they are ſo much addicted?</p>

               <p>That they delight in ignorance, it appeareth, in that they commend the colliars faith, that could anſweare the Diuell nothing, <hi>but that he beleeued as the Church beleeueth,</hi> albeit

               </p>
               <p>That they deprine lay-men of all ordinary meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in matters of faith, it appeareth firſt, for that they ſeldome permit ſcriptures tranſlated into vulgar tongues to be read by them. but Scriptures as the Apoſtle teacheth vs 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>are profitable to inſtruct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they expreſſely forbid them to bee read pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the Church. their ſeruice alſo and adminiſtration of ſacraments, is for the moſt part in tongues not vnderſtood of the vulgar ſort.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they wil not ſuffer lay-men to diſpute of matters of faith. for they are excommunicate, if they do it, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarrus in enchirid. in</hi> 1. <hi>praecept. c.</hi> 11. declareth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, their preachers ſeldome teach the people. and when they doe it, yet as <hi>Dante canto.</hi> 29. ſaith, they preach their owne inuentions, and tell idle tales without edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Cornelius Agrippa de vanit. ſcient. c. de theolog.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that for the Goſpell, and Gods word they preach meere toies, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions. pro euangelijs &amp; pro verbo Dei meras nugas &amp; humana verba crepant praedicantes euangelium, adulterantes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei.</hi>

               <p>TRue religion reſtreineth mens affections, and directeth Chriſtians in the right way. the <hi>Pſalmiſt pſ.</hi> 119. asking this queſtion <hi>wherewith a yoong man ſhall redreſſe his way?</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>in taking heede thereto according to Gods word.</hi> the ſame alſo directeth vs by a ſtrait and narrow way vnto life. <hi>enter in,</hi> ſaith our Sauior, <hi>Matt.</hi> 7. <hi>at the ſtrait gate:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>for the gate is ſtrait, and the way narrow that leadeth vnto life.</hi> but popiſh religion looſeth the reins to allicentiouſnes, and leadeth Chriſtians by a broade, pleaſant and eaſie way to the end of their deſires. for firſt they account adultery &amp; fornication ſmall ſinnes, and giue libertie to euery Biſhop to diſpence with them, as they teach publikely in the Chap. <hi>&amp; ſi clerici. de iudicijs. de adulterijs, &amp; alijs criminibus, quae ſunt minora,</hi> ſaith <hi>Alexander the third, poteſt epiſcopus cum clericis post peractam poenitentiam diſpenſare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next they allow publike ſtewes both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe the Pope maketh a great gaine of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Agrippa de vanit. ſcient. c. de Lenocinio,</hi> ſaith, that the reuenue of the Pope ariſing of the tribute of whores, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to <hi>twentie thouſand</hi> crownes. but now it farre paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that ſumme. the gloſſe vpon a certaine prouincial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Otho, de concubinis cleric. remouend.</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it ſeemeth reaſon, that the church ſhould winke at the ſinne of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie. nam &amp; mareſchallus Papae de facto exigit tributum à me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retricibus. for de facto the Popes marſhall exacteth a tribute of whores.</hi> this is alſo teſtified by <hi>Ioannes Andreas</hi> in <hi>c. inter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera. de ſpon. &amp; matrim.</hi> a certaine Maſſe-prieſt alſo in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bich mainteined not long ſince, <hi>that whores were in Rome with approbation, and with as good right as any citizen of Rome, or as the Pope himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:18506:105"/>
               <p>Thirdly it is notorious, that Maſſe-prieſts both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> and other places keepe concubines. the ſame is alſo teſtified by <hi>Aluarus Pelagius de Planct. eccleſiae. Theodoric à Niem tractat nemor. vnion.</hi> and diuers others. <hi>Cornclius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa de vanit. ſcient c. de lenocinio</hi> reporteth, that they kept whores to hire. <hi>Ambroſius Anſbertus in Apocalypſ.</hi> 18. ſaith, <hi>that archdeacons take mony of adulterous Prieſts. archidiacont a preſbyteris adulteris pretium accipiunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly they teach, that concupiſcence is no ſinne. and in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> the common people goe as commonly to common women, as if it were no ſinne.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, albeit the Friers and Prieſts condemne ſuch ſins, yet if any come vnto them for abſolution, they deny it not, and that vpon ſome ſmall hope of almes, or elſe ſome other ſmall ſatisfaction. and this is the reaſon, that luſt doth reigne in Popery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Germaines</hi> in their greeuances complaine, that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of granting indulgences was a warrant for men to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all filthineſſe: and In <hi>Italy</hi> it is knowen, that they that come ofteneſt to confeſſion are moſt looſe liuers. after their offence they come for abſolution, and after abſolution of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend againe.</p>
               <p>The way alſo, by which Popiſh Prieſts leade their follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is broade, eaſie and pleaſant. <hi>Bellarmine de eccleſ. mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. c.</hi> 2. requireth in a true member of the Catholike church, neither <hi>inward faith, nor other vertue,</hi> but only, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe outwardly the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion and be ſubiect to the Pope; a matter of no great difficulty.</p>
               <p>If a man take vpon him the habit of a Monke or a Frier, they make it <hi>a ſecond baptiſate,</hi> and that ſtate, they ſay, <hi>is a ſtate of perfection.</hi> ſo you ſee how eaſie a matter it is with Papiſts, not only to be a true member of the church, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a perfect Chriſtian. for who cannot take vpon him a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars or Monkes weede? in the apologie for <hi>Herodotus</hi> it is teſtified, that a certaine Frier taught, <hi>that the only way for the Diuell to be ſaued, was to put on Saint Francis his coule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further they teach, that the Pope hath power, <hi>to grant
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18506:105"/>pardons for fornication, adultery, inceſt, rapes, murders, periurie, trechery, ſodomitrie, maraniſmes</hi> and all vices, as appeareth by the Popes penitentiary taxes, and that for no great ſums of money. now what more eaſie then to obteine the Popes pardon?</p>
               <p>If a man heare Maſſe euery Sunday &amp; holyday, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe at ſhrouetide, and be houſeled at Eaſter, and faſt from fleſh, and obſerue the reſt of the Romiſh precepts and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, he is taken for a good Catholike. but theſe are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be performed without any great difficulty.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts alſo teach, that Chriſtians are iuſtified by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnction: which is a matter to bee obteined at euery pild Prieſtes-hands.</p>
               <p>They promiſe alſo generall indulgences to ſuch as viſit certaine churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> and elſe where; which may bee done with ſmall labour.</p>
               <p>Now for veniall ſinnes they ſay, <hi>that knocking of the breſt,</hi> and <hi>holy water is remedy ſufficient.</hi> for ſuch matters they ſay Chriſtians neede not to repent them. they hold alſo, that holy water is good to driue away diuels. but in no place is there want of holy water.</p>
               <p>If a man liue all his life moſt leudly and looſely, yet if he confeſſe to a prieſt when he lieth a dying, and promiſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, he faileth not to haue abſolution; and if he ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not in this life; yet they hold, that either by Maſſes, or indulgences, he may be deliuered out of Purgatory. but indulgences are not deare, and Maſſes are dogge cheape. a trentall is not valued at 30. pence, nor whole fardels at great ſums.</p>
               <p>By euery ſmall good worke, nay by eating red-herrings and ſaltfiſh on fridaies, and ſuch obſeruances they hope to merit heauen. ſo broad they make the way to heauen, and ſo eaſie a matter to come thither.</p>
               <p>Finally as <hi>Eunomius</hi> promiſed them, that profeſſed his faith reward in heauen, <hi>howſoeuer they liued;</hi> ſo likewiſe doe the Papiſts promiſe heauen to their followers, ſo they profeſſe and ſet forward the Popes cauſe. whether they be murdrers
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:18506:106"/>of Kings, or maſſacrers, or rebels, or filthie whore-mongers, or Sodomites, it skilleth not; the Maſſe-prieſts promiſe not only pardon, but alſo reward in heauen, ſo they die in the Popes obedience, and profeſſe his religion.</p>
               <p>This religion therefore that giueth ſuch liberty to ſinners, and leadeth them ſuch pleaſant waies, feeding the eies of people with ſights, their eares with pleaſant ſoundes, and ſatisfying all their ſenſes with carnall pleaſures, cannot bee true.</p>
               <p>We could alſo ſpecifie the ſame by infinit examples, and by particulars ſhew, that papiſts run the broade way, but that we reſerue it to the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>GOod trees are knowen by their fruits. let vs then ſee what fruits haue come of Popery, that we may know, whether the tree be good or no, from whence they haue iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. <hi>Briſtow</hi> in his 39. <hi>Motiue</hi> imagineth, that we haue nothing to ſay againſt his conſorts, and therefore braggeth much of workes, and deſpiſeth his aduerſaries, as running the broade-way to deſtruction. but when his conſorts ſhall ſee our diſcourſe concerning the fruits &amp; effects of Poperie, and their ſtrange &amp; enormous wicked liues, they will wiſh, that for this matter we had neuer beene called in queſtion. Firſt then wee ſaie, that the Papiſtes erre in the doctrine of workes, and next that their liues are ſo diſorderly, as if they did only ſtudy to excell in all wickedneſſe, leudeneſſe and villanie.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians beleeue, that the law of God is a perfect rule of good life. but they hold, that not only Gods lawes, but all ſcriptures are imperfect, and inſufficient without traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:18506:106"/>
               <p>Chriſtians beleeue, that the perfection of Chriſtian life conſiſteth in the Goſpell. but theſe teach, that the rules of <hi>Benet, Francis, Dominicke</hi> and other monkes and friers, doe direct vs to a further perfection, then is commanded in the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>They doe as well beleeue, that the lawes of the Pope do binde our conſciences, as Gods lawes, and thinke, that the workes done according to the Popes lawes do as well pleaſe God, as the works commanded in Gods lawes.</p>
               <p>They make more conſcience to abſteine from fleſh on Friday, then to murder Chriſtians, as their curioſitie in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that forme of faſt, and their crueltie in murdring and maſſacring Chriſtians doth declare.</p>
               <p>The Maſſe-prieſts giue abſolution to moſt haynous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and enioyne them penance afterward. the Pope grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indulgences to moſt horrible offenders.</p>
               <p>They beleeue not that concupiſcence is ſinne, or that it is better for Votaries to marry then to burne, or that Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſinnes deſerue the curſe of the law, or eternall death.</p>
               <p>They teach that euery Chriſtian is to ſatisfie for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paines due to ſinnes, and that either in this life, or in the life to come, in purgatorie.</p>
               <p>They beleeue that a man may be iuſtified by extreme vnction, and other popiſh ſacraments, and by the works of the law, and not by faith in <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſuppoſe, that euery man is able to performe the workes of the law perfectly. of which it followeth, that, as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> taught, <hi>a man may liue without ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally by their workes they hope to merit eternall life; which is directly contrary to the Apoſtles doctrine <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. who teacheth vs, that <hi>eternall life is the gift of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then the Papiſtes erre ſo groſſely both in the doctrine of works, and alſo in the rule of our works, it is not like, that their works are excellent.</p>
               <p>Nay we finde by practiſe, that their workes are for the moſt part impious, and diſpleaſing vnto God, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the adoration of the croſſe and ſacrament, their blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:18506:107"/>praiers to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Angels and Saints, their ſacrilegious taking of the cup of the new teſtament from Gods people, their worſhip done to Antichriſt, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries and rebellions againſt Princes; their murdring Gods ſaints, their mainteining of publicke ſtewes and bankes of vſury, and ſuch like. the reſt cannot much pleaſe God or man: as for example, the begging of vagabond friers, the forſwearing of mariage, the eating of muſcles, cockles and red herrings in Lent, the taking of aſhes on Aſhwedneſday, the ringing and ſinging for dead men, the ſhauing of prieſts crownes, the greaſing of ſicke men, of altars, bels, and ſuch like toies and ceremonies.</p>
               <p>But to let theſe workes paſſe, wherin the papiſtes pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more then God or good men, we wil declare, that no ſect of heretikes euer did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit more heinous offences, or offended more commonly in matters by themſelues not denied to be ſinnes, then the principall of the Popiſh ſect. the forme of confeſſion commonly preſcribed to Romiſh penitents by the ordinall is this. <hi>Confiteor quia peccaui nimis in ſuperbia, inani gloria, in extollentia tam oculorum quam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtium &amp; omnium actuum mcorum, in inuidia, in odio, in auari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia tam honoris, quam pecuniae, in ira in triſtitia, in acedia, in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris ingluuie, in luxuria Sodomitica &amp;c.</hi> ſo they confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues guiltie of all their 7. deadly ſinnes, and adde Sodomie and many other villanies.</p>

               <p>THe diuel being the author of all vntrueth and falſhood, it may well be ſaid, that all the lying and falſe doctrine of papiſts is of the diuel. but beſide this, there are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons, why we call Popery <hi>the doctrine of diuels.</hi> for firſt diuers points of popiſh doctrine are ſpecially ſaid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the diuell, and next the beſt proofes and meanes which our aduerſaries haue to maintaine their doctrine, are from the diuell.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. calleth the prohibition of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and lawes of abſtinence from certaine meates, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of diuels. for ſpeaking of doctrines of diuels after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſpecifieth the ſame, ſaying, <hi>forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſteine from meats, which God hath created.</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:18506:111"/>but Papiſts by law expreſſely forbid marriage to prieſts, and others that haue vowed ſingle life, and the eating of fleſh on faſting daies, and white ſoule in lent. neither can they excuſe themſelues, for that they doe not condemne mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as ſimply euill, or fleſh as vncleane. for <hi>Thcodoret</hi> ſheweth, that ſuch came within the compaſſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles cenſure, as by law prohibited theſe things, further nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Encratites</hi> or <hi>Manichees</hi> abſolutely forbid mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as vncleane, but as not fitting ſuch as tende to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>Likewiſe he calleth it a doctrine of diuels, to giue diuine worſhip to dead men. but this is a common practiſe among Papiſtes. for by Saints they ſweare, and to them they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes, and in honour of them they build chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and altars, and ſay maſſes: all which are ſpeciall points of diuine honour.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIII.</hi> That Papiſts can haue no aſſurance of the truth of their religion.</head>
               <p>OF the trueth of our Chriſtian faith we are aſſured. for the articles thereof were deliuered by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> taught by the Apoſtles and Prophets, conteined in Scriptures, and confeſſed by the catholicke church of all times. but it is not ſo with Popery. for neither did <hi>Christ</hi> deliuer it, nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Prophets teach it, nor is the ſame conteined in Scriptures, or confeſſed by the catholike church of all times, but dependeth partly vpon traditions not written, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the Popes determinations, and partly vpon the opinions of ſchoole-men and canoniſtes, and the monkes and friers. now what aſſurance I pray you, can any Papiſt haue of theſe doctrines?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> no man yet could euer tell what theſe traditions are, which the Prieſts of <hi>Trent</hi> would make equall to Scriptures. <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de verb. dei</hi> talketh at randon. but he dare not come to particulars, nor directly expreſſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> they dare not define, where theſe traditions are to be found. if they ſay in the decretales; then all future tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are cut off, and former traditions founded on the Popes opinions. if they ſay in the legends, their traditions will prooue lies and fooleries. for ſuch are the legends. if they tell vs of the pure fountaines of traditions of <hi>Caeſar Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> as Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fift doth, they will be laughed at, that were not auiſed of their groundes, before the time of this babling and confuſed Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> they cannot ſhew, why ſome traditions ſhould be obſerued, and others not. but if traditions were to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with equall affection to holy Scriptures, then might none be aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>As for the determinations of Popes, they can alledge no reaſon, why they ſhould be true. if they bring the wordes
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18506:113"/>of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> they concerne them nothing, that are ſo vnlike to <hi>Peter.</hi> if they bring <hi>Chriſts</hi> promiſes to his church, they concerne them much leſſe. for they are rather enemies, then members of the church. but were they members, yet what man is priuiledged ſo, that he cannot erre, but thoſe which for writing of holy Scriptures were led into all truth by the holy Ghoſt, which is the ſpirit of truth?</p>
               <p>Finally there is ſuch contention betwixt the ſchoolemen and canoniſts, and ſuch diuerſity of opinions among the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Doctors of both the ſides, that it is bard to ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any of them teacheth truly, and moſt certaine, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them teach falſely. nay ſcarce any point of doctrine is deliuered by ſchoolemen, wherein they diſſent not one from another.</p>
               <p>Now if they ſay, their faith is founded, not only vpon the Popes determinations, and Apoſtolike traditions, but alſo vpon holy ſcriptures, yet holding as they doe, this ſhall not any whit releeue them.</p>
               <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> they cannot aſſure themſelues, that the Latine vulgar tranſlation of the Bible is more true, then the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall text in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greeke.</hi> for all the fathers with one conſent preferre the original fountaines before all verſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> they muſt needes ſtand in doubt, which is the old Latine vulgar tranſlation. for if they allow that which was ſet out by <hi>Clement the</hi> 8. then cannot they allow of that, which was ſet out by <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> the one ſo much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the other. nor if they approue this, can they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> they doe not beleeue the ſcriptures, becauſe God ſpeaketh in them, nor the traditions becauſe they are Gods worde, as they hold, but becauſe the church doth tell vs, which are canonicall ſcriptures, and conſigneth them vnto vs, and doth further deliuer vnto vs theſe traditions not written. for this is <hi>Stapletons</hi> opinion in his bookes <hi>de doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalibus princip.</hi> and <hi>authorit. eccleſiaſt. defenſ.</hi> and is confeſſed of moſt Papiſts. but if the authoritie of ſcriptures, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in reſpect of vs, doth ſo depend vpon the church,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18506:113"/>that no man can be aſſured of either, without the authority of the Church, then doth the faith of Papiſts reſt vpon the Pope, who, as they ſay, is chiefe gouernor of the church. the which will bring the Papiſts to great vncertainty. for who is ſo mad, as to beleeue, that a blind Pope can well iudge of colours, or ſo ſenſeleſſe, as not to beleeue Gods word without the Popes warrant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> they receiue not the articles of the faith, becauſe they are contained in ſcriptures, but becauſe they are deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs by the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> 2.2.9.1. <hi>art</hi> 10. ſaith, that the ordring of matters of faith, and the publication of the articles of the Creed belongeth to the pope, &amp; that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed was receiued, becauſe it was allowed by the Pope. and this by others is deliuered in more groſſe termes. <hi>Stapleton</hi> in his doctrinall principles ſaith, <hi>that the laſt reſolution of matters of faith is in the Popes deſinitiue ſentence.</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de verb. dei c.</hi> 4. goeth about to ſhew, that the Pope is the ſupreme iudge, to whom the interpretation of ſcriptures, and laſt reſolution of all controuerſies of religion is to bee referred.</p>
               <p>But the papiſts can neither aſſure thomſelues, that he that ſitteth at <hi>Rome</hi> is true Pope, and <hi>S. Peters</hi> true ſucceſſor, nor that his determinations are certeine or true. That the Pope is <hi>S. Peters</hi> true ſucceſſor, it will be hard to proue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that he preacheth not, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> did, nor <hi>S. Peter</hi> weare a triple crowne, and command temporall Princes, as he doth. it is very hard alſo to know, whether he bee true Pope or no after the common vnderſtanding of Papiſts. for vnleſſe he bee baptized, and truly ordred and choſen, he is no true Pope. but it is hard to know, whether he were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, which dependeth vpon the Prieſts intention, which is vncerteine and hidden. it is alſo more hard to vnderſtand, whether he were truly ordred or not. for if he were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, then is he not capable of Prieſt-hood, as <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſaith <hi>c. ventens. de preſbytero non baptizato.</hi> and if he that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him, had no intention to doe it, then receiued he no
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18506:114"/>orders. laſtly it is a matter moſt difficult, to know, whether the Pope was rightly choſen, or elſe by Simony, or violence, or other meanes intruded. ſo it is alwaies moſt vncertaine, whether the Pope be <hi>S. Peters</hi> ſucceſſor, and a lawfull Pope, yea or no.</p>
               <p>In the Popes determinations alſo there is great vncertein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and doubt. for neither can the Papiſts, that were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Popes conſiſtory, beleeue for certeine, that the Pope hath thus or thus determined, vnleſſe they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, either this or that Maſſe-prieſt, that telleth him ſo, or the notary that ſubſcribeth the decretale, or the decretale it ſelfe: nor can they aſſure themſelues, that the Popes deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is true. If they beleeue euery Maſſe-prieſt, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie; then is the faith of Papiſts built vpon euery pild pated Prieſts report, or notaries ſubſcription. if they beleeue the Popes decretales, becauſe they find them written; then doe they giue more credit to the Popes decretales, then to holy ſcriptures: which is moſt abſurd and impious. that the Pope determineth infallibly true, how can they aſſure themſelues, ſeeing the ſcriptures pronounce all men liers, and ſubiect to infirmities? furthermore we reade, that the chieſe Prieſts vnder the law erred diuerſſie, as the offence of <hi>Aaron</hi> in making the golden calfe, of <hi>Vriah</hi> the Prieſt, that made an altar, after the forme of that of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> that condemned <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> doth plainlie declare. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo erred in denying his maſter and diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his paſſion, and in <hi>Iudaizing,</hi> and diſſembling his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. the biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue erred, as <hi>Lyra</hi> confeſſeth in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and may erre, as <hi>Adrian lib. de ſacrament. c. de co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſirmat.</hi> determineth. The examples alſo of <hi>Marcellinus, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius, Felix, Anaſtaſius the</hi> 2. <hi>Vigilius, Honorius</hi> the firſt, <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. and other Popes doe proue the ſame. <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine epiſt.</hi> 19. doth teſtifie, that the writers of canonical ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only are priuiledged ſo, as they cannot erre. of other writers he thinketh otherwiſe. and this is alſo the opinion of other fathers. finally reaſon may perſwade vs, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this truth. for we ſee no more in the biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:18506:114"/>then other biſhops, and leſſe then in other learned men. but other biſhops and learned men both haue erred, and may erre. if they ſay, that <hi>Peters</hi> chaire is priuiledged; then muſt they ſhew, that the biſhops of <hi>Antioch</hi> &amp; <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which haue as much right to <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, as <hi>Rome,</hi> haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer erred. but this they know cannot be done.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that neither in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions, nor in the Popes decretales there is any certainty, all depending of the Popes ſuppoſed determinations, of which no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie can be had. the ſame alſo may be ſhewed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinions of popiſh doctors in euery point of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, and for that all their errors are plainly conuinced both by ſcriptures and fathers. but becauſe they place their principall defence in the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, we will only ſhew their want of aſſurance in this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then no Papiſt in the world is able to ſhew, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the whole Maſſe, or the canon was inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Apoſtles. nay we ſee plainly words newly thruſt into the forme of conſecration of the cup; and popiſh doctors themſelues confeſſe, that diuers parts of the Maſſe haue beene made by ſeuerall Popes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> they cannot ſhew for a thouſand yeeres after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that any Prieſt was ordeined to offer <hi>Chriſtes</hi> bodie and blood really for quicke and dead.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſuppoſe the Maſſe were lawful, &amp; the Prieſt lawful, and all the reſt of the lawleſſe and ſuperſtitious tricks lawful; yet can no man aſſure himſelfe, that the Prieſt hath truely conſecrated. for firſt no man can tell whether the man at the altar be a Prieſt, vnleſſe he know, that he was baptized, and that the biſhop ordring him had an intention to doe it. <hi>Secondly</hi> no man can aſſure himſelfe, that either he had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to conſecrate, or pronounced the wordes of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, or not. for they are pronounced ſoftly.</p>
               <p>Are not the Papiſtes then miſerable, who are ſo vncertaine of their Maſſe, and know not, whether they worſhip bread, or God, whether they ſerue God or creatures, whether they be Chriſtians or idolaters?</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIIII.</hi> That Popery is repugnant to the lawes of Nations.</head>
               <p>BVt could the Papiſts perſwade themſelues, that their Maſſing ſacrifice were lawfull and the reſt of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were true; yet who would not abhorre that religion, which is grounded on ſuch foundations, and conteineth ſuch impieties, hereſies and falſe doctrines, and is ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant both to Catholike religion, and all antiquity?</p>
               <p>Further we finde, that it ouerthroweth the lawes of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſſolueth the bands of alliance and kinred, preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the authoritie of Kings and Princes, hazardeth their liues and perſons, oppreſſeth the liberty of Chriſtians, both for matters of conſcience, and their temporall eſtate, and is maintained by lies, calumniations, forgeries, periuries, fire and ſword, and moſt diſhoneſt and wicked means.</p>
               <p>The lawes of nations require, that oathes, promiſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactes, leagues and treaties of trade and commerce be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and kept. but all theſe bonds neither Popes nor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts regard. <hi>Formoſus</hi> being depoſed from his biſhopricke, ſwore, that he would neuer reſume the ſame againe. yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded he not his oath. <hi>Gregorie the</hi> 7. was made Pope con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his oath, as appeareth in the life of <hi>Henrie the</hi> 4. <hi>Paſchal the</hi> 2. ſolemnely ſwore to <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperor, to obſerue certeine articles agreed vpon betwixt them. but he was no ſoner out of his hands, but he broke his oath, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the Emperor, and excommunicated him. <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, as <hi>Theodoric a Niem</hi> teſtifieth <hi>tract. nemor. vnion.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 14. chargeth <hi>Gregory the</hi> 12. and <hi>Benedict the</hi> 13. <hi>with violating their oathes, vowes and promiſes. Violarunt ſidem</hi> ſaith he, <hi>fregerunt votum, promiſſum non tenucrunt. Omiphrius</hi> chargeth <hi>Alexander the</hi> 6. with <hi>more then Punicke perſidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. perſidia plus quam punica. Guicciardin</hi> in his hiſtory ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Clement the</hi> 7. ſaith, he <hi>regarded his oath but little. era di poca ſede.</hi> he ſheweth alſo, how <hi>Iulius the ſecond</hi> endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18506:115"/>to prooue, <hi>that the church,</hi> that is, the Pope, as he meant, was not <hi>bound by any oath.</hi> and that appeareth to haue beene moſt currant doctrine by diuers perfidious prankes plaied by <hi>Leo the</hi> 10. <hi>Clement the</hi> 7. and diuers other Popes mentioned by <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and diuers of the Popes owne friends and paraſites.</p>
               <p>Neither doe they only breake oathes themſelues, but perſwade all their complices to doe the like. the Biſhop of <hi>Verdune,</hi> as we reade in <hi>Conradus Traiectenſis</hi> relateth, how <hi>Gregory the</hi> 7. eſteemed faith to <hi>be ſacrilege, and them to bee loyall, that broke their othes to the emperor. periuria ſidelita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem dicit, fidem ſacrilegium ſacit. Henry the</hi> 4. alſo, as we read in <hi>Helmoldus</hi> complained, that his ſubſects by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Pope <hi>rebelled againſt their lord, and broke their ſaith and ſolemne oathes. lenarunt manus contra dominum &amp; regem ſuum, &amp; violauerunt ſidem, &amp; iuramentorum ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Pope and his complices perſuaded the emperor moſt diſhonorably to violate his ſafe conduct granted to <hi>Iohn Huſſe.</hi> there alſo it was decreed that faith was not to be held with heretikes. they endeuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lately to perſuade the emperor <hi>Charles the fift</hi> likewiſe to breake with <hi>Luther. Paul the</hi> 3. in his bull againſt <hi>King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> 8. did pronounce them accurſed, that would not breake oathes, and couenauts made with him, or with his ſubiects. <hi>Eugenius the</hi> 4. was the cauſe that <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> did breake with the <hi>Turke.</hi> the like practiſes haue diuers Popes vſed to cauſe ſubiects to rebell againſt Princes. <hi>Innocentius the</hi> 3. moued the Engliſh contrary to their oaths to rebell againſt King <hi>Iohn.</hi> and the like courſe did <hi>Paul the third</hi> take againſt King <hi>Henry the eight,</hi> and <hi>Pius the ſiſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory. the late tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were diuers of them tied by ſpeciall oathes to King <hi>lames.</hi> but with gun-ponder they meant to blow away oaths, and honeſtie. Finally it may truly be ſaid of the Pope, and his complices, that they take themſelues no further bound by their oathes, then their profit requireth. ſo one ſaid alſo
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18506:116"/>in expreſſe termes of them. <hi>multis annis iam peractis, nulla ſides eſt in pactis. for many yeares they haue regarded no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactes.</hi> and by this ſtratagem they haue preuailed againſt the Emperors, and other Princes, and ſetting the Chriſtian world vpon a flame, haue warmed themſelues by the fire.</p>
               <p>We read alſo that diuers leagues and treaties of peace by the wicked perſwaſions of Popes and their adherents and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents haue beene violated. The <hi>Spaniarde</hi> and Engliſh in time paſt enterteined peace one with another, but <hi>Pius the fifth</hi> by his agents ſet the one nation againſt the other. by the practiſes of Popes and their agents we find, that the freuch King <hi>Charles the</hi> 9. broke the articles of peace both with his ſubiects and other Princes, and cauſed many thouſand inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to be murdred and maſſacred throughout his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome anno 1572. <hi>Philip the</hi> 2. King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the priuiledges of the low countries, nor the articles of the pacification at <hi>Gant</hi> anno 1576. but that he was moned thereunto by the continuall perſwaſions of the Pope. nay <hi>Paul the third</hi> doubted not to curſe all thoſe, that would not breake with king <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. vpon his excommunication.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, by the lawes of nations, warres are either publickely proclaimed, or after refuſall of reſtitution of goods wrongfully taken, by ſome heraulds or others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. but the Pope contrary to all lawes, cauſed the <hi>Spaniardes anno</hi> 1588. to come againſt <hi>England,</hi> before any warre was denounced. the ſame courſe alſo did <hi>Paul the</hi> 3. hold in his warres againſt the Germans. neither doe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts end euour any thing more, then to take Chriſtians on ſleepe, and ſo to ſteale vpon them and to cut their throates. and this appeared lately moſt clearely in the cruell conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of the ponder men, and vndermining papiſts.</p>
               <p>Great reſpect is alwaies had to ambaſſadors and agents ſent to treat of war or peace. And this is<note n="*" place="margin">C. in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> confirmed by the lawes of al nations. but Popes haue oftentimes euill entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Emperors ambaſſadors. <hi>Gregorius</hi> 7. <hi>nuntios Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rici Imperatoris carceri mandauit,</hi> as we reade in <hi>Orthuinus Gratius</hi> in certaine epiſtles ſet downe together with the

               <p>Finally by the lawes of nations, kings haue ſoueraigne power ouer their ſubiects. and neither can ſubiects abandon their Princes, nor oppugne them, nor may kings oppreſſe their ſubiects, or ſuffer them to be maſſacred by the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of antichriſt or others. but by the doctrine of papiſtes all Kings are ſubiect to the Pope, as they teach in the chap. <hi>vnam ſanctam. extr. de maiorit. &amp; obed.</hi> and diuers other places. the ſame alſo is prooued, for that diuers Popes take vpon them to take away Princes crownes. the Popes do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with the oathes of Princes made to their ſubiects, and with the oathes of ſubiects made to their Princes. of which, many calamities doe proceede. <hi>Papa cum Achaiae principem</hi> ſaith <hi>Pachymeres lib. hiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>c. vlt. iureiurando, quod Paleologo dederat ſoluiſſet, contmentium bellorum cauſam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buit. the Pope abſoluing the Prince of Achaia from his oath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Paleologus, was cauſe of diuers troubles one following vpon the necke of another.</hi> and the like inconueniences haue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vpon the like preſumption of Popes in taking vpon them to controll kings, and to ſtirre their ſubiects againſt them. but what need we to ſeeke for examples in ancient hiſtories, when the calamities hapning in <hi>France</hi> by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the league againſt the King, and in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Popes inſolent excommunications and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations in this caſe, are ſo freſh in memorie? is it not then maruell, that ſo many nations ſhould embrace the doctrine of Popery, that is ſo repugnant to the lawes of nations, and rights both of Princes and ſubiects founded on the lawes of nations?</p>

               <p>THere is no bond ſtraiter then that, which is betwixt parents and their children. and naturally men are encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to loue their kinſmen and allies. but this falſe religion, which is profeſſed by Papiſts, and founded vpon the Pope, diſſolueth all bandes of alliance and kindred, and ſetteth the children againſt the parents, and the parents againſt the children. <hi>Paſchale the</hi> 2. and his adherents, as <hi>Helmoldus</hi> teſtifieth, armed the ſonne againſt the father. <hi>Paſchalis &amp; Pontifices Germani,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſilium Henricum contra patrem armarunt, &amp; vicerunt.</hi> likewiſe <hi>Gregory the</hi> 9. made <hi>Henry</hi> the ſonne, head of a ſtrong league againſt <hi>Frederic the</hi> 2. his father, as is teſtified by <hi>Auentinus in annal.

               <p>It is alſo a common practiſe of children in places where Popery reigneth, to abandon their parents, and to profeſſe monkerie. <hi>Airault</hi> of <hi>Angiers</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a man of good note, loſt his onely ſonne, by the entiſement of the Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, perſwaded to enter into their ſuperſtitious order; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the father euer after heare what was become of him. and ſo haue many parents beene depriued of their ſonnes and daughters vnder colour of religion, oftentimes drawen away to ſerue the Maſſe-prieſts abominable luſtes. this among Papiſts is counted religion. but the example ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth rather of Turkiſh, then Chriſtian religion. for as the children of Chriſtians are taken from their parents and friends and made <hi>Ianizars,</hi> and ſo emploied in the warres againſt <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> ſo theſe nouices are by fraud and wilie deuiſes ſtollen from their Chriſtian parents and friends, and afterward emploied in the defence of antichriſtian doctrine againſt truth, and the profeſſors thereof.</p>
               <p>Finally they that profeſſe Popery zealouſly doe forget oftentimes all lawes of common ciuility. lately the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-men Papiſts had thought to cut all their countrimens throtes. the Maſle-prieſts eſteeme lay-men no otherwiſe then dogges and hogges commonly when they appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore magiſtrates, that are not of their owne religion, they giue them no reuerence. <hi>Alexander the third</hi> trode vpon the Emperor <hi>Fredericke Barbaroſſaes</hi> necke. <hi>Adrian the</hi> 4. ſuffered him to hold his ſtirrop. other Popes haue vſed Kings and Princes as their ſtaſſiers. and for their hands they

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> That Kings profeſsing Popiſh religion are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no Kings, or but halfe Kings.</head>
               <p>BVt were not Kings in danger to loſe their crownes and Kingdomes liuing vnder the Pope; yet haue they no reaſon to take vpon themſelues as free Kings and Princes, or to beleeue, that they can enioy all the right that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18506:121"/>to lawfull Kings and Princes.</p>
               <p>For firſt no King can freely diſpoſe of matters belonging to his gouernement, that acknoledgeth any man to be his ſuperior. as for example, <hi>Herode</hi> and other Kings, that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnder the Romans, who could proceed no further, then pleaſed the Emperors, and people of Rome. if then the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or other nations do acknowledge the Pope to be his iudge and ſuperior, he may not refuſe his iudgement, or reſiſt his authority.</p>
               <p>Secondly we find, that Kings before Chriſts comming in the fleſh gaue lawes both to the chiefe prieſts, and to all their people; and not the chiefe prieſt either to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> or to the people, as may appeare by the lawes of <hi>Moyſes, Ioſue, Dauid, Salomon, Hezekia &amp; Ioſiah.</hi> we do alſo read, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> &amp; other Chriſtian Kings, vntill the times of <hi>Charles</hi> the great and long after, gaue lawes to the Biſhops of Rome and other clergy-men, as may be eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proued by the lawes yet extant <hi>Cod. de ſum. trinit. &amp; ſid. cath. de epiſc. &amp; Cleric. de epiſcop. audient. de haereticis,</hi> and in diuers other titles, and books. but where any biſhop of Rome all this time made any law to bind either kings, or their ſubiects, we find not, vnleſſe we liſt to admit counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet decretales for currant lawes, which no man of any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtanding will doe, nor any modeſt Papiſt can require. wherefore taking vpon them authority to make lawes to binde both Kings and their ſubiects, the Popes plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that Kings lining vnder the confuſion of Antichriſts tyranny, are no kings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>Bellarmme lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de pontif. Rom. c.</hi> 7. determineth <hi>that temperall Princes are no gouernors of the Church.</hi> and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally both the Pope and his complices teach, that kings haue no power, either to make eccleſiaſticall lawes, or to reforme abuſes of doctrine, or to ſettle matters eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. finally the Papiſts of <hi>England</hi> in their gloſing petitions to his Maieſty, wherein they pray his fauour, yet will allow him no authority, ſaue only in temporall and ciuill cauſes. doth it not then manifeſtly appeare, that Papiſts take from
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18506:121"/>kings halfe their authority, and giue the ſame to forreiners, and publike enemies?</p>
               <p>Fourthly in temporall matters, which they are content to leaue to the diſpoſition of Kings, they reſtraine them in ſuch ſort, that they wil not haue them either to reſt in peace, when the Pope commandeth them to make warres, or to make warres further then the Pope permitteth. <hi>Bomface the eight in c. vam ſanctam. extr. de maiorit. &amp; obed.</hi> ſheweth how princes are to vſe their ſwords, <hi>ad nutum &amp; patientiam ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotis.</hi> that is, <hi>at the Popes beck, &amp; as long as he liſteth to ſuffer it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly the Pope ſhareth halfe the kings reuenues, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenths, firſt fruits, ſubſidies, and other rights out of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall liuings. he doth alſo claime the diſpoſition of diuers eccleſiaſtical liuings in diuers caſes, and right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme biſhops, and getteth great ſummes of money for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, licences, and other reſcripts, and faculties.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, if a king need a diſpenſation againſt an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call law, or an abſolution from an offence. he is ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to obteine it if be can, and oftentimes ſuch faculties and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions coſt full deare. King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. ſpent great ſummes of money to be diuorced from his brothers wife, and yet failed of his purpoſe. <hi>Fredericke the</hi> 2. could not be abſolued from his excommunication by <hi>Gregory the</hi> 9. but it coſt him 125. M. ounces of gold, as <hi>Nauclere and Iuan de Pineda</hi> a Spaniard doe ſignifie. <hi>Iohn</hi> the king of <hi>England</hi> to obteine abſolution was forced to reſigne his crowne.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, <hi>Alex. inder</hi> the fourth in the chapter <hi>quia non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli. de immunit. eccleſ. in</hi> 6. exempteth the poſſeſſions and goods of clergie men from tolle and cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Bomface the</hi> 8. in the chapter <hi>clericis. de immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. eccleſ. m</hi> 6. doth excommunicate both kings and others, that impoſe taxes and ſubſidies vpon the clergy. and this is the common doctrine of the Popes agents. <hi>Bellarmine de exemptione clericorum c.</hi> 1. ſetteth downe theſe propoſitions, <hi>that clerkes in eccleſiaſticall cauſes are free from the command of ſecular Princes by the law of God.</hi> and againe, <hi>that clerkes are not to be iudged of ſecular iudges, albeit they tranſgreſſe
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18506:122"/>temporall lawes.</hi> and laſtly, <hi>that Princes in reſpect of clerkes are not ſoueraigne Princes. Emanuel Sa</hi> in his Aphoriſmes for confeſſaries, firſt printed and alledged by him, that wrote <hi>the Franke diſcourſe,</hi> hath theſe wordes, <hi>clerici rebellio in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem non eſt crimen laeſaemaieſtatis, quia non eſt ſubditus regi. the rebellion of a clerke againſt the king is no treaſon, becauſe he is not the kings ſubiect.</hi> nay of late both the maſſe-prieſts and their firie followers haue thought it meritorious to rebell againſt the king.</p>
               <p>And conſonant to this doctrine is the practiſe of papiſts, for in matters of contention betwixt the Pope and their kings, they take part with the Pope, and rebell againſt their kings, as the rebellions of the <hi>Germaines</hi> and <hi>French</hi> in time paſt, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> againſt king <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. and Queene <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> of the leaguers of <hi>France</hi> againſt king <hi>Henry the</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. doe manifeſtly declare.</p>
               <p>When the Pope doth giue law to Princes, they take themſelues bound to execute it, and vpon euery excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication riſe in armes againſt them, and ſeeke to depoſe them.</p>
               <p>In eccleſiaſticall cauſes they runne for direction to the Pope, and care not a ſtraw for the eccleſiaſticall lawes of their kings.</p>
               <p>When the Pope commandeth a Prince to execute his bulles, they are ready to follow the warres. if he command them to ſurceaſe, they forſake their kings in the midſt of his conqueſts.</p>
               <p>If the Pope leuy tenthes or ſubſidies vpon the clergy, or Monkes, or Friers, they willingly beare all burthens, and to him they runne for diſpenſations, and all faculties.</p>
               <p>Kings alſo ſeeke to the Pope in their owne caſes for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations, and abſolutions, where the Popes law ſaith, they are neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Finally both the poſſeſſions and perſons of clergy men are the Popes to diſpoſe, as may appeare, for that he layeth what charge he liſteth on their poſſeſſions, and ſometimes alienateth them to mainteine his warres, and findeth their
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18506:122"/>perſons preſt to doe him ſeruice.</p>
               <p>If then kings beare themſelues as inferiors to the Pope, and receiue lawes at his hands, and are excluded from all diſpoſition and rule in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and both draw their ſwords and put them vp at his command, and ſuffer him to taxe their ſubiects, and run to him for faculties and diſpenſations, and finally can neither diſpoſe of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the church, nor of the perſons of church-men; we may boldly ſay, that Poperie either maketh kings no kings, or but halfe kings.</p>

                  <hi>DAuid</hi> the man of God would not ſuffer any of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to lay his hands vpon <hi>Saul,</hi> although God had appointed him to ſucceed in the kingdome, and reiected <hi>Saul.</hi> and great reſpect alwaies haue Chriſtians had to their ſoueraigne Lords and Princes. In the canons attributed to the Apoſtles <hi>c.</hi> 83. euery contumelious ſpech againſt the Emperour, or magiſtrat is iudged worthy of puniſhment. what are we then to thinke of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their complices, that not only curſe and raile againſt princes and magiſtrates, but alſo ſtirre vp all the world againſt them, if they will not yeeld to their Lordly will and pleaſure? ſuch certes are the children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and not the ſeruants of God. I hope therefore Chriſtian Princes will open their eies, and euery day grow more wary in their dealings with the popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their agents, which are no leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in reſpect of their liues and perſons, then their roiall eſtats and kingdomes.</p>
               <p>For firſt they hold, that is lawfull for the Pope <hi>to change kingdomes, and to take from one, and to giue to another,</hi> as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in expreſſe termes determineth <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>de pont. Rom. c.</hi> 6.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18506:123"/>And this is declared by the continuall practiſe of Popes, who theſe many yeares haue gone about to take from one, and to giue to another, now giuing the kingdome of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> now to the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> now challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it themſelues. the kingdome of <hi>Nauarre</hi> is holden from the <hi>French</hi> king by no better warrant, then the Popes grant. by the ſame alſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portingals</hi> haue diuided the Indians betwixt them. <hi>Boniface the eight</hi> by his bull made <hi>Philip</hi> and the kingdome of <hi>France</hi> ſubiect to <hi>Albert.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> they teach, that the Pope is to iudge of Kings, as is defined by the extranagant <hi>vnamſ. inctam. de maiorit. &amp; obed.</hi> they giue the Pope alſo power to depoſe kings, and to take away their crownes. but it were great ſimplicity to thinke, that any magnanimous Prince will either loſe his crowne, or ſubmit himſelfe to be iudged by a pole-ſhorne Pope without force. nay ſooner will he hazard his life, then either looſe his crowne, or ſubmit himſelfe to the Popes iudgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> both by their doctrine and practiſe it appeareth, that the Popes and their agents haue ſought to murder, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſon and deſtroy ſuch kings and princes, as either were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat by them, or elſe were oppoſite vnto them. <hi>Gregory the</hi> 7. <hi>watching the Emperor, that was wont to pray in the church of S. Mary.</hi> as <hi>Beno</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>hired a fellow to place great ſtones vpon the beames or vault of the church right ouer the place where he praied, which being throwne downe might kill him.</hi> his words are theſe. <hi>imperator ſolitus erat frequenter ire ad oration: mad eccleſiam S.

                  <hi>Innocent the ſecond</hi> hauing raiſed an armie fought with <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Sicilia</hi> in a pitcht field, thinking to deſtroie him.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus Quintus anno</hi> 1588. in his declaration againſt the foreſaide Lady exhorteth her people to lay hands on her, to arreſt her, <hi>and to concurre to her puniſhment.</hi> and to this ende tendeth the moſt ſeditious and wicked libell ſet out by <hi>Allen,</hi> yet not without the helpe of <hi>Parſons,</hi> and directed <hi>to the nobility and people of England and Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When force preuailed not, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents by trechery ſought to murder her. <hi>William Parry anno</hi> 1584. reſolued to murder that innocent Queene, and his purpoſe did ſo well pleaſe Pope <hi>Gregory the</hi> 13. that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Como</hi> in the Popes name promiſed him pardon of all his ſinnes, and a great reward beſides for his indeuour. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignor,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>his holineſſe hath ſeene your letters, with the credential note included, and cannot but commend the good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which as you write, you hold for the ſeruice and benefit of the publike weale: wherein he exhorteth you to continue vntill
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18506:124"/>you haue brought it to effect. and that you may be holpen by that good ſpirit, that hath mooued you, he granteth you his bleſſing and plenary indulgences, and plenary remiſſion of all your ſins. aſſuring you beſide the merit which you ſhall haue in heauen, that his holines wil make himſelf your debtor to acknowledge your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts in the beſt ſort he can.</hi> thus the Pope promiſeth heauen to a wicked murderer: and with him concurred one <hi>Benedict Palmio</hi> a Iebuſite of <hi>Venice,</hi> and other Iebuſites and Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts in <hi>France,</hi> all ſetting this aſſaſſin &amp; cutthroate on to murder an innocent Queene. <hi>Parſons</hi> that ringleader of trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when an Engliſh gentle man went about to diſcouer this treaſon, by all meanes diſturned and diſtwaded him, furthering with his deſires this moſt wicked reſolution of <hi>Parry,</hi> as is cuident by his letters dated the 18. <hi>of October an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1598. which are yet to be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>That which <hi>Parry</hi> entended, diuers other traytors alſo promiſed to performe, as <hi>Sauage</hi> enduced thereto by the perſwaſion of <hi>D. Gifford,</hi> and other prieſts at <hi>Paris; Ballard,</hi> who was ſet on by <hi>Allen; Somerfield,</hi> who was encouraged in the enterpriſe by <hi>Arden,</hi> and a Romiſh maſte-prieſt; <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke Collen, Yorke</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> who were enduced thereto by <hi>ſir William Stanley, Hugh Owen, Holt, Sherwood, Gifford, Worthington</hi> and others to commit this villanous fact.</p>
               <p>In the end <hi>Lopez</hi> the Queenes Phyſicion vndertooke to empoiſon the Queene vpon hope of a great ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and one <hi>Squire</hi> promiſed <hi>Walpoole</hi> to practiſe the ſame treaſon, damning himſelfe, if he did not execute that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous act, and receiuing the Sacrament vpon it. ſuch zeale haue theſe wicked <hi>Iebuſites</hi> to doe miſchiefe. neither doe they now deſiſt from theſe wicked attempts, as their treacherous plots againſt king <hi>Iames</hi> declare.</p>
               <p>Of late time <hi>Henry the</hi> 3. of <hi>France</hi> was moſt ſhamefullie murthered by a Dominican Frier called <hi>Iames Clement,</hi> and the fact was highly praiſed by the Pope.</p>
               <p>The like fact did <hi>Peter Barrier</hi> attempt againſt <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> animated therein by diuers <hi>Iebuſites</hi> &amp; maſſe-prieſts, as appeareth by his confeſſion ſet downe in record.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:18506:125"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Chaſtell</hi> ſtroke the ſame king with a knife, thinking to murder him, and this he learned, as he confeſſed in his examination, of the <hi>Iebuſites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The late Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> was firſt wounded by <hi>Iohn Iau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regui,</hi> and afterward murdred by <hi>Balthaſar Gerard.</hi> both which were perſwaded by Maſſe-prieſts and Friers, that ſuch facts were meritorious. finally diuers haue beene hired and ſent by the Popes agents to murder Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> as namely <hi>Michael Reinichon, Peter du Four,</hi> and <hi>Peter Panne.</hi> and this is euidently declared by their confeſſions, by diuers preſumptions, and by their execution for this cauſe.</p>
               <p>If then ſuch rewards be promiſed to ſuch, as attempt to empoiſon, and murder Princes; let all Chriſtian Princes beware, how they admit ſuch neere their perſons, as beleene this wicked doctrine. and let them neuer forget the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous treaſon of the Engliſh-miners and gun-pouder-men.</p>
               <p>If Papiſts thinke it meritorious to kill princes excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate by the Pope, and are therein animated by him and his agents; then can Godly Princes haue no aſſurance of their liues before they roote out all the profeſſors of this King-killing and bloody religion. and this appeareth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently by the treaſon contriued the fifth of Nouember laſt.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXXIX.</hi> That Popery laieth greeuous burthens on mens conſciences.</head>
               <p>OVr Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Matth.</hi> 23. denounced a woe to the Scribes and Phariſees, for that <hi>they ſhutte the Kingdome of heauen before men, and neither entred themſelues, nor ſuffered others to enter therein.</hi> he taxeth them alſo, for that <hi>they bound heauy and importable burthens on mens ſhoulders, and did not ſo much as once touch them with one of their ſingers.</hi> but better may the ſame woe be denounced againſt the Phariſaical Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Monkes, and Maſſe-prieſts, which keeping the people of God from the knowledge of Gods word, and nouzeling
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18506:125"/>them vp in ignorance, as much as in them lieth, do faſt ſhut the kingdome of heauen againſt them, and while they ſeeke to mainteine their pompous ſtate, and refuſe to heare all ſpeech of reformation, neither enter themſelues, nor ſuffer others to enter into the kingdome of heauen. Furthermore they doe not onely tie their followers to obſerue vnwritten traditions, as did the hypocriticall Scribes and Phariſees, but alſo lay vpon them diuers other moſt heauy and gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous burthens.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> they preſſe men with diuers heauy ſtatues and laws. for example, they binde men to confeſſe to their parochial prieſt once euery yeere. they require that confeſſion be <hi>ſimple, humble, pure, faithfull, frequent, naked, diſcreet, willing, baſhfull, full and ſecret,</hi> &amp;c. according to theſe verſes:
<q>
                     <l>Sit ſimplex, humilis confeſſio, pura, fidelis,</l>

                     <l>Fortis, &amp; accuſans, &amp; ſit parêre parata.</l>
                  </q> And vnleſſe all mortall ſinnes be confeſſed, they ſay it auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth nothing. but who can either tell all his ſinnes, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue all theſe conditions? they alſo binde men to keepe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holy-daies and ſet feaſts and faſtes, and that with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine conditions. Further they teach, that all Chriſtians are to obſerue the ſtatutes of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> and decretales of Popes, and actes of their pretended councels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> euery tranſgreſſion of the ſtatutes of the Romiſh church, and of the Popes decretales they puniſh with greeuous penalties. to eate fleſh on fridaies, to eate egges in Lent, to reade holy Scriptures in vulgar tongues, without recantation, is capitall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> they hold, that euery law of the Romiſh church doth binde in conſcience. nay if ſubiects rebell not againſt their Princes, and lay handes vpon them, they teach that they ſinne mortally. if then all tranſgreſſions of the Popes lawes be ſinne; then are Papiſtes tied with infinite chaines of ſinnes. they looſe all theſe lawes, I confeſſe, lightly, but alwaies this ſcruple will remaine, whether they haue rightly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18506:126"/>confeſſed, and haue fully ſatisfied, and are iuſtly abſolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> the cenſures of the Romiſh church euen to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts haue alwaies ſeemed intolerable. <hi>Peter de Aliaco</hi> in his booke <hi>de reformat. eccleſ.</hi> complaineth of it, and ſheweth how the ſword of the church by frequent excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is growne contemptible. hee complaineth alſo of the multitude of irregularities. adde hereunto the greeuances proceeding of ſuſpenſions and interditements, and then the burthen muſt needs ſeeme more greenous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> ſuch as doe not in matters of faith or Sacraments iumpe with the Romiſh church, they pronounce heretikes, as appeareth by the chap. <hi>ad abolendam. de haereticis.</hi> they giue them alſo ouer to the ſecular power to be put to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly</hi> they make Kings and Princes their butchers and executioners, ſorcing them by ſentence of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to cut the throat of Chriſtes lambes, whom they moſt wrongfully haue pronounced heretikes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seuenthly</hi> they burthen their clergy &amp; their religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders both of men and women with a vow of ſingle life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they finde themſelues moſt vnable to performe it. they force alſo the monkes, friers, and nunnes to obſerue mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh rules, which are oftentimes full of fooleries, and ſtande for the moſt part vpon externall ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> like to Scribes and Phariſees they haue brought into the church infinite traditions and ceremonies. nay the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> doth paragon and make equal vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten traditions to Gods written worde. and yet no Papiſt euer yet could tell, what thoſe traditions were, or in what bookes they were to be found. In baptiſme they vſe ſalt, ſpittle, blowings, lights, and greaſing in the Maſſe the prieſt turneth, heaueth, skippeth, ſwingeth the chalice to and fro, moppeth, moweth, ducketh, ſpeaketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times high, ſometimes lowe, and maketh no end of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. the conſecrating of ſalt, holy-water, oyle, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal lambes, new houſes, new ſhippes, is not done without many ceremonies. in hallowing and rehallowing of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſaying of canonicall houres and offices many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18506:126"/>paſſe, but few to purpoſe. the Biſhop in conſecrating a church walketh round about it, as if there were no entrance in. and in the end abuſing a verſicle of a pſalm ſaith, <hi>attollite portas principes veſtras.</hi> and entring maketh the Greeke and Latine alphabet, and ſetteth lights before croſſes, made on walles, and greaſeth ſtones. the yeare of <hi>Iubiley</hi> aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with ceremonies. the Pope knocketh firſt at <hi>S. Peters</hi> church dore with a golden hammer, ſhewing that no man obteineth indulgences, but he muſt ſpend gold. then the Prieſts ſhew their wares, and ignorant people goeth about viſiting certeine churches and reliques, of which we neuer read word in the Goſpell, or writings of the fathers.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts therefore are intangled with a miſerable yoke of bondage, and are vtterly ignorant of the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made vs free. God open their eies, that they may ſee, and giue them grace, that they may feele their burthens, and ſhaking off the yoke of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> may in the end bee partakers of the light of the Goſpell, and ſubmit themſelues only to <hi>Chriſts</hi> yoke, that is eaſie and light.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> That the Popiſh church hath no true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor Prieſts.</head>
               <p>THe gouernment of the Popiſh church being ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome and dangerous cannot well be tolerated by rules of policy. but if the ſame be againſt both ſcriptures and canons of the church, then as repugnant both to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Chriſtian policy it is to be abandoned of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an common-wealthes. let vs then conſider, what allowance it may haue either of ſcriptures or ancient canons.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Act.</hi> 20. ſaith, that the holy ghoſt <hi>hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Biſhops to gouerne the Church of God. in quo vos ſpiritus ſanctus poſuit Epiſcopos, regere eccleſiam dei,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking of the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia.</hi> but the popiſh church hath no true Biſhops. and that is prooued firſt, for that biſhops cannot be orderned but by true Biſhops. but the prelats of the Romiſh church are ordeined by the Pope, that is no Biſhop. the propoſition is granted. of the aſſumption the firſt part is not denied. in the ſecond part our aduerſaties inſiſt firmely and affirme the Pope to be a true biſhop. but how can he be a Biſhop, that neither preacheth, nor can preach, nor admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the Sacraments, nor ſucceedeth the Apoſtles in their Apoſtolicall office? the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. ſheweth that the office of a biſhop conſiſteth in the worke, and not in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. <hi>qui Epiſcopatum deſiderat bonum opus deſiderat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly antichriſt can ordeine no true biſhops. but that the Pope is antichriſt I haue declared in my fiſt booke <hi>de Pontif. Rom.</hi> and it is apparent in that he teacheth doctrine
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18506:130"/>contrary to that which we haue receined from Chriſt Ieſus. and is plainly deſcribed in the Reuelation by the whoore of Babylon Apocalypſ. 17. and by the beaſt like a lambe riſing out of the earth <hi>Apocalypſ.</hi> 13. which are figures of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, none but the ſucceſſors of <hi>Chriſts</hi> apoſtles can ordaine true biſhops. but the Pope ſucceedeth <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> rather then <hi>Simon Peter.</hi> for <hi>Simon Peter</hi> fed Chriſts flocke. he murdreth <hi>Chriſts</hi> lambes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, neither heretikes nor ſimoniacall perſons haue power to ordeine biſhops, as the maſter of the ſentences <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>dist.</hi> 25. prooueth by the authoritie of <hi>Cyprian, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Leo.</hi> and this is the practiſe of the Romiſh church at this day, who refuſeth to allow them for biſhops, that are ordred by ſuch as they repute heretikes or ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes. ſome determine otherwiſe, but they repugne againſt the Romiſh churches practiſe.</p>
               <p>Finally, no woman can ordeine biſhops. but Pope <hi>Ioan</hi> was a woman. and therefore all ordeined by her, and their ſucceſſors are no biſhops by the confeſſion of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themſelues.</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer it is, the Papiſts cannot aſſure themſelues, that they haue any biſhops. for no man is ordeined biſhop, vnleſſe he that ordeined him had an intention to order him a biſhop. but of this intention no man can aſſure himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the Popiſh ſynagogue hath no true prieſts. for their prieſts are all ordred to ſacrifice for quicke and dead.</p>
               <p>The forme of prieſthood ſay the Maſſe-prieſts aſſembled at <hi>Florence</hi> is this, <hi>accipe poteſtatem offerendi ſacrificium in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia pro vinis &amp; mortuis.</hi> and this is prooued alſo by their rituall bookes, and by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> confeſſion, <hi>lib. deord c.</hi> 9. but ſuch prieſts were neuer appointed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. neither is there any footeſtep of ſuch an ordination to be found in ancient fathers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, no true prieſts can be ordeined by other, then true biſhops, and the Apoſtles ſucceſſors. but ſuch biſhops
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18506:130"/>the ſynagogue of Rome wanteth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly true prieſts and miniſters of the Goſpell are ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to preach Gods word truely, and to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ſincerely. but popiſh prieſts are not ordered to this end.</p>
               <p>If then that cannot be the church, that wanteth prieſts and biſhops; then are we not to looke for the true church among the papiſts. but <hi>Hierome in dialog. contr. Lucifer.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, <hi>that to be the church, that hath no prieſts.</hi> and <hi>Cyprian lib.</hi> 4. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 9. teacheth, <hi>that the church is a people or flocke vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, if all the ordination of biſhops and prieſts in the Romiſh church dependeth vpon the Pope, and the Pope be not mentioned either <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. or 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where all the miniſters of the church giuen to the ſame by Chriſt, are mentioned; then doth the ordination of Roman prieſts and prelates take his beginning not from Chriſt, but from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the function of maſſe-prieſts doth conſiſt in ſaying Maſſe, and the Maſſe be prooued to be an humane inuention; then is the Romiſh prieſthood an humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention. but otherwhere we haue ſufficiently declared, that the Maſſe was by little and little peeced togither, and is a meere humane inuention: nay an inuention contrarie to <hi>Chriſts</hi> inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XLII.</hi> That Popery cannot be mainteined without forgery and falſhood.</head>
               <p>THis point of it ſelfe alone would require a large diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if we ſhould proſecure particularly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatſoeuer our aduerſaries haue herein offended. for whether we reſpect the diuers kinds of forgeries, or the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of authors forged and falſified by them, it were a great worke to comprehend them all. we will therefore chooſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18506:131"/>out ſome few examples out of many, whereby all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may haue cauſe ſufficient to ſuſpect them in the reſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt then we charge them with falſity, for that as much as in them lieth, they haue gone about to ſuppreſſe Gods eternall word compriſed in the old and new teſtament. that this is falſitie, it is apparent by the law, <hi>qui teſtamentum. ff. ad legem corneliam de falſis.</hi> for by that law they are condemned <hi>qui teſtamentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amouerint celauerint.</hi> that is, <hi>which ſhall amooue or conceile a teſtament.</hi> but the Pope and his complices for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid expreſſely all tranſlations of the new teſtament made by our doctors, and only grant certaine tranſlations made by themſelues, and that with hard conditions: as is declared in the index of forbidden bookes <hi>reg.</hi> 3. <hi>and</hi> 4. but publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will not haue ſcriptures red in vulgar tongues.</p>
               <p>Secondly they burne the holy ſcriptures vnder pretenſe of falſe tranſlations. but the law formerly cited doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him a falſarie, that ſhall aboliſh or cancell or burne a mans teſtament. the words of the law are theſe: <hi>ſi quis te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentum deleuerit:</hi> that is, <hi>if any ſhall cancell a teſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly it is falſity to cancell, or breake the ſeales of a teſtament, as the practiſe of the law of this land declareth. how then can the Popiſh ſynagogue of Rome excuſe it ſelfe, that depriueth the lords people of the cup <hi>which our ſauiour Chriſt</hi> calleth <hi>the new teſtament in his blood?</hi> is not this, all one, as if the ſame ſhould breake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeales of Gods teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>Fourthly they haue added their owne traditions to the old and new teſtament, receiuing with like affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence both ſcriptures and traditions, as they write <hi>ſeſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ſynod. trid. Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaketh no otherwiſe of traditions, then as if they were <hi>the word of God not written.</hi> but to adde to a mans teſtament is forgery. <hi>hominis teſtamentum</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. <hi>nemo ſpernit aut ſuperordinet. no man deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a mans teſtament, or taketh vpon him to adde vnto it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly they haue added to the canon of the old teſtament the bookes of <hi>Tobia, Iudith, Eccleſiaſticus, Wiſdome, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabies</hi> and certaine fragments not extant in the originall
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18506:131"/>bookes of ſcriptures. but to aſcribe bookes to the ſpirit of God, which were not publiſhed by the authority of Gods ſpirit, is an audacious kind of falſity. that they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical ſcriptures, it is proued by the teſtimony of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> of <hi>Hierome in prologo Galeato, Athanaſius in ſynopſi, Nazianzen in carminibus, and diuers others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixtly, certaine Friers <hi>anno D.</hi> 1256. in <hi>Paris,</hi> for <hi>Chriſts</hi> goſpell publiſhed an other goſpell, which they termed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. <hi>fratres noua quaedam praedicabant, legebant, docebant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenta ex libris Ioachim abbatis, incipit<expan>

                     </expan> eorum liber Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium aeternum,</hi> as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> teſtifieth. but no greater falſitie by men pretending Chriſtianity can be committed, then in exhibiting a falſe Goſpell. <hi>S. Paul Galath.</hi> 1. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth ſuch teachers accurſed.</p>
               <p>Finally, the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> hath committed an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious falſity in making the old Latine tranſlation of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authenticall. for the ſame in many places diſſenteth from the orginall bookes, as by conference it appeareth, and as <hi>Iſidore Clarius</hi> in his preface to the tranſlation of the bible, <hi>Eraſmus, Caietane</hi> and diuers other learned interpreters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and declare. diuers editions alſo of this Latine tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe much differ, as appeareth by the bibles ſet foorth by <hi>Sixtus quintus, Clement the eight,</hi> and diuers others. but that cannot be true, that diſcordeth with it ſelfe. <hi>quod diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonat, verum eſſe non poteſt.</hi> neither can they excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of falſity, that exhibit a falſe copy, for the true ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, and authenticall bookes of ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe haue our aduerſaries corrupted and falſified both the acts of councels, and the writings of the fathers. for firſt they ſuppreſſe the true acts of many councels, and the true bookes of many fathers, ſuch eſpecially as touch the authority of the biſhop of Rome. <hi>Poſſeuin</hi> in his <hi>ſelect bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliotheke</hi> counſelleth his conſorts, <hi>to keepe the Greeke origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bookes of councels and fathers from the view of yong ſtudents.</hi> but to ſuppreſſe the depoſitions of witneſſes all law adiudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth falſity.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:18506:132"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> they haue ſet foorth diuers falſe actes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons vnder the names of the Apoſtles, of the ſynode of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> vnder <hi>Silueſter,</hi> of <hi>Neoceſaria, Sinueſſa</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſynods, which themſelues cannot denie to be diuerſly falſified. <hi>Iſidore c. canones. diſt.</hi> 16. and <hi>Leo c. Clementis. diſt. ead.</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius c. ſancta Rom. diſt.</hi> 15. doe number theſe canons among apocryphall writings. the canons themſelues condemne the baptiſme of heretikes <hi>c.</hi> 45. and once dipping in baptiſme <hi>c.</hi> 49. and Saterdaies faſt. <hi>c.</hi> 65. and alloweth the 3. booke <hi>of Machabees,</hi> and <hi>Clements epiſtles</hi> for canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcriptures; and yet pope <hi>Adrian c. ſextam ſynodum. diſt.</hi> 16. alloweth them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ruſſin</hi> in his hiſtory, and <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome c. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginti. diſt.</hi> 16. allowe only 20. canons of the councel of <hi>Nice.</hi> others in <hi>c. ſeptuaginta. ead. diſt.</hi> ſay there are 70. one <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus of Piſa</hi> of late in his ſumme of councels, hath ſet out 80. canons of that councell. <hi>Sozimus</hi> in the 6. councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> was taken alleaging a falſe canon of that councell for appeals to <hi>Rome. Paſchaſius,</hi> or ſome vnder his name, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted a canon of that councell, as if the ſame had decreed <hi>that the Church of Rome had alwaies had the primacy. Pius the fifth</hi> in certaine letters of his to the Emperor alledgeth, that <hi>the councell of Nice made the Pope of Rome gouernor of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes.</hi> the falſification is notorious, and is extant in his letters ſet out by <hi>Hierome Catena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the acts of the councell of <hi>Sinneſſa</hi> there are 3. <hi>copies extant in Surius,</hi> and different each from other. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelues alſo. for where in the latter end it is ſaid, that the firſt See ſhall not be iudged of any, the fathers of that councell notwithſtanding condemned <hi>Marcellinus. damnauerunt eum extra ciuitatem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The actes of the councels of <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> and <hi>Ancyra</hi> are ſo ſimple, and ſo repugnant to the ſtate of thoſe times, that blindemen, albeit void of ſight, may feele them to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet. in ancient ſtories there is no mention of them. nay in times of perſecution, and before <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time it is
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18506:132"/>not likely that ſo many biſhops could meete, or would make ſuch acts, and canons, as are imagined to be made in thoſe councels.</p>
               <p>The ſynode ſuppoſed to be aſſembled at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Silue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> contemeth diuers fabulous points, as namely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Conſtantines</hi> leproſy, of <hi>Nunnes profeſſing virginitie after the age of</hi> 72. yeres. The biſhops names are barbarous. the ſtile is Gothike. the number of biſhops there aſſembled is incredible. it is therfore meere impudency to affirme the acts of that ſynode to be authenticall.</p>
               <p>The 18. canon of the councell of <hi>Chalceden,</hi> and the 36. canon of the 6. ſynode that giueth equall authority to the ſee of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> is falſified. both by <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Gregory the</hi> 13. in his new edition of the canon law. for vnder colour of thoſe canons they determine quite contrary to canons, that <hi>the Church of Conſtantinople ſhould not be equall to Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fift councell of <hi>Carthage c.</hi> 3. determineth that bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, prieſts and deacons ſhould abſteine from their wiues in the time of their turnes, or ſeruice, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. but the <hi>Romaniſtes diſt.</hi> 33. <hi>c. placuit.</hi> haue falſified this canon by adding ſubdeacons, and excluding biſhops, prieſts, and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons from their wiues at all times.</p>
               <p>The councell of <hi>Mileuis c.</hi> 22. forbiddeth Prieſts, and inferiour clerks to appeale to <hi>Rome.</hi> but <hi>Gratian</hi> falſifying the canon, addeth theſe words, <hi>niſi forte ſedem Rom. appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauerint.</hi> which is direct contrarie to the meaning of the councell.</p>
               <p>In the 35. <hi>canon</hi> of the councell of <hi>Laodicea</hi> the worſhip of Angels is termed idolatrous and expreſſely forbidden. but <hi>Carranza</hi> in his ſumme falſifieth the canon, and for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelos, writeth Angulos.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de ſanct. beatitud. c.</hi> 19. ſheweth, that in latter editions of councels his conſorts haue eſtabliſhed the inuocation of Saints by the 7. <hi>canon of the</hi> 6. <hi>ſynode.</hi> but all ancient copies declare both him and his conſorts to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious forgers of falſe canons.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:18506:133"/>
               <p>It were an eaſie matter to ſhew the falſhood of our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in diuers other canons. but the breuitie of this diſcourſe will not permit any larger number of witneſſes in this point.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, vnder the names of fathers they haue ſet out diuers counterfet treatiſes, and haue falſly both tranſlated the Greeke fathers, and alleadged both Greeke and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine writers. vnder the name of <hi>Clement</hi> they haue publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed diuers conſtitutions, and doe alledge them verie fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. yet doth <hi>Gelaſius c. ſancta. diſt.</hi> 15. ſet a marke vpon them, as Apocryphal. to him alſo they aſcribe certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions and epiſtles, which ſauour not of an apoſtolicall ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Vnder the name of <hi>Origen</hi> they publiſh certaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> which conteine plaine Arianiſme. and his lamentation which is noted by <hi>Gelaſius</hi> as Apocryphal. <hi>Tertullians</hi> and <hi>Ruſſins</hi> treatiſes are diuerſly cited. yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by <hi>Gelaſius c. ſancta Romana. dist.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Vnder the authoritie of <hi>Abdias, Martialis, Prochorus, Amphilochius,</hi> and diuers ancient fathers, they couer diuers of their owne baſtardly inuentions, no way agreeing with thoſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> is ſaid to haue written the treatiſe <hi>de reuelatione capitis Ioannis,</hi> wherein mention is made of king <hi>Pipin,</hi> and a booke <hi>de montibus Sion &amp; Sinah,</hi> and diuers other treatiſes, neither according with his phraſe, nor with thoſe times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierome</hi> is made to father a ſermon <hi>de aſſumptione B.

               </p>
               <p>The ſermons <hi>ad fratres in eremo,</hi> and diuers others <hi>de tempore &amp; ſanctis,</hi> attributed to <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> are plainely counterfet. ſo are his meditations alſo and ſoliloquies. in thoſe meditations the worſhip of Angels is taught, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke <hi>de haereſib.</hi> condemneth for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. in the ſoliloquies we reade the fable of <hi>Longinus.</hi> in his <hi>manual c.</hi> 16. we reade, <hi>that it is in mans power to merit the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18506:133"/>kingdome of heauen:</hi> which is plaine Pelagianiſme, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>S.

Auguſtine,</hi> are but groſſe deuiſes of ſlow bellied monkes and friers.</p>
               <p>Vnder the name of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> they haue ſet out counterfet Maſſes, and diuers epiſtles, homilies and treatiſes, that are no where found in Greeke, nor any whit ſauour of the diuine ſpirit of thoſe fathers. nay ſo ſhameleſſe they are, that they ſticke not to ſet out Maſſes vnder the name of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Marke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like practiſe they haue vſed in the workes of other fathers. but to father baſtardes vpon wrong fathers, is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious tricke of falſitie, as appeareth by the law <hi>cum ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiti. Cod. ad l. Corn. de falſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By their expurgatorie Indexes they cauſe the fathers writings to be changed, not onely by falſe additions, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by detractions. <hi>Sixtus Senenſis in epiſt. ad Pium</hi> 5. <hi>antè biblioth. ſanctam,</hi> ſheweth, how that Pope did handle or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mangle and change the fathers writings. <hi>expurgari &amp; emaculari curasti,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>omnia catholicorum ſcriptorum, ac praecipuè veterum patrum ſcripta haereticorum aetatis noſtrae faeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus contaminata &amp; venenis infecta.</hi> ſo vnder this colour it was an eaſie matter to take out what he liſted. In <hi>Bertram</hi> they change <hi>viſibiliter</hi> into <hi>inuiſibiliter,</hi> and cut out whole lines and ſentences. <hi>Poſſeuin</hi> a ſhameleſſe Iebuſite teacheth his ſchollers, how <hi>Hermes, Melito, Cabaſilas, Anaſtaſius, Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Abbas</hi> and other authors were to be corrupted and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to his purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly they haue corrupted diuers lawes, and ſome they haue forged vnder the name of diuers Emperours and Kings. vnder the name of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Pope challengeth a right to moſt kingdomes of the Weſterne Empire. but the donation ſet out vnder his name both by teſtimony of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, and by diuers arguments is prooued counterfet.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the conſtitution of <hi>Ludouicus dist.</hi> 63. <hi>c. ego Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus,</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:18506:134"/>is a plaine baſtard. for it contradicteth <hi>Constantines</hi> donation, was neuer executed, and differeth from it ſelfe, as appeareth by the diuers editions of <hi>Gratian</hi> and <hi>Volateran Geograph. lib.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>The law <hi>inter Claras. Cod. de ſum. Trin. &amp; fid. cath.</hi> is not found in ancient copies, as <hi>Alciat</hi> teſtifieth <hi>Parerg. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 23. likewiſe the ſame is diſprooued by diuers other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alledged by me in a treatiſe of Popiſh forgeries and lies.</p>
               <p>In the Popes archiues they ſhew a ſolemne donation of the crowne of England, made by king <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the ſtate, to the Pope. but the ſame is cleerely counterfet, being neither executed by the king, nor allowed by the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The ſtatute <hi>anno</hi> 2. <hi>Henr.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15. is plainly falſified by the Popiſh clergie in a prouinciall conſtitution made at <hi>Oxford,</hi> by adding, <hi>ac etiam communitates regni.</hi> whereas in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall role yet extant in the Towre there are no ſuch wordes found. it appeareth therefore, that by forgery they haue made ſtatutes to ſerue their turnes for the burning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that they haue murdred them hitherto contrarie to forme of law.</p>
               <p>Finally vnder the names of ancient biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> they haue publiſhed diuers counterfet epiſtles differing from their forme of writing in ſtile, and conteining matters not agreeing with the times, when they are ſuppoſed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Clement epiſt.</hi> 1. writeth to <hi>Iames</hi> of the death of <hi>Peter,</hi> who died diners yeeres before <hi>Peter.</hi> and <hi>epiſt.</hi> 2. taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to inſtruct <hi>Iames</hi> an Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anacletus</hi> in his firſt epiſtle would haue all matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> but at that time the church of <hi>Rome</hi> had no ſuch prerogatiue. neither was it reaſon, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt then liuing, all matters ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred rather to <hi>Anacletus</hi> then to him. in his 2. epiſtle he ſaith, the 72. diſciples were inſtituted by the Apoſtles: which the Goſpel ſaith were appointed by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18506:134"/>whereas theſe cuſtomes came not into the church vntil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres after.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hyginus</hi> wrote to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> but it is not like, that a Greeke, would write to <hi>Greekes</hi> in Latin.</p>

                  <hi>Calixtus</hi> mentioneth thoſe heretikes, which denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to ſuch as fell in time of perſecution. but this was the hereſie of <hi>Nouatus,</hi> who troubled the church long after <hi>Calixtus</hi> his time.</p>

               <p>It is an eaſie matter to ſhew other epiſtles attributed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> to be counterfet. but it is needleſſe, conſidering how <hi>Antonius Contius in annot. ante c. viginti. diſt.</hi> 16. confeſſeth, <hi>that all the decretals of Popes before Silueſters time are counterfet,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that he hath prooued it.

               </p>
               <p>Others giue out, that he was conuicted of <hi>Sodomy,</hi> and burned on the backe for his offence at <hi>Noyon.</hi> but the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſſe of thoſe that firſt deuiſed this ſlander may be refuted by diuers plaine arguments. firſt <hi>Sodomites</hi> are not burned on the backe in <hi>France,</hi> but burned at a ſtake. ſecondly neuer was he conuented before any iudge either for that or other matter. Laſtly, the ſincerity of his life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth to ſuch beaſtlineſſe. neither was it like, that he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18506:138"/>would haue ſo violently purſued the Romaniſts for their vnnaturall abominations, vnleſſe he had beene cleere of all ſuſpition in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bellarmine lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de eccleſ. c.</hi> 14. ſaith that <hi>Caluin</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to worke a miracle by compact with one <hi>Bruley.</hi> but he ſheweth himſelfe therein miraculouſly impudent. for in the ſame chapter he confeſſeth, that <hi>Calum</hi> in the preface to his Inſtitutions ſhould complaine, that wrong was offered chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by thoſe, that required miracles at their hand, ſeeing they taught the doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, which was confirmed by innumerable miracles. further it is a ſhameleſſe tricke to alledge the teſtimony of <hi>Bolſec</hi> who was hired to write, what he could, againſt <hi>Caluin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Coſter</hi> ſaie, <hi>that Calum was eaten vp with lice, and died blaſpheming and calling vpon the diuell.</hi> a diueliſh ſlander refuted by <hi>Galaſius, Beza</hi> and the publike teſtimony of the city of <hi>Geneua.</hi> a litle before his death, ſay they, he <hi>called his fellow miniſters vnto him, exhorted them with many words full of piety and affection, and departed this life ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like to one falling a ſlepe, then dying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Beza</hi> is charged for affirming, that Chriſt had two hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſes or perſonall ſubſiſtences. but his aduerſaries deale with him calumniouſly. for he confeſſeth and teacheth, that Chriſt was one perſon, albeit the ſame Chriſt was very God and very man, the two natures being vnited in one perſon, and the ſoule and the body being vnited in one man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feuardentius in Iacob.</hi> 3. and <hi>Stapleton in prompt. hebdom.</hi> 3. <hi>quadrageſ.</hi> and others raile at <hi>Beza</hi> for his verſes, which he made being a yong man. But <hi>Beza</hi> did firſt condemne thoſe verſes himſelfe, as being made while he was an impure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. and yet compare them with the Italian rymes, that are euery where extant, and with the verſes of <hi>Caſa</hi> and other <hi>Italians,</hi> they may ſeeme modeſt and chaſt in reſpect.</p>
               <p>Finally of late time the ſhameleſſe <hi>Iebuſites</hi> of <hi>France</hi> publiſhed a pamphlet of <hi>Bezaes</hi> recantation, and reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to the Pope fraught with diuers lies. but <hi>Beza</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe refuced their impudent lies, and now the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18506:138"/>ſelues will not deny, but that this was a lying and impudent pamphlet.</p>
               <p>This is alſo the practiſe of Papiſts from time to time, to ſclander and to bely the ſeruants of God. In <hi>the</hi> 8. <hi>ſeſſion of</hi> the conuenticle of <hi>Conſtance</hi> the Maſſe-prieſtes charge <hi>Wickleſſe, that he taught, that God muſt obey the diuell.</hi> a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no where ſound either in termes, or in ſenſe in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. they ſaid alſo, how he taught, <hi>that Princes being in mortall ſinne are not to be obeied.</hi> his drift was only to ſhew, that prelates liuing looſely were vnworthy of their places, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he did not detract from the efficacy of ſacraments mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by them. the right of kings againſt the vſurpations of the Clergy he ſtoutly mainteined.</p>
               <p>In the ſame wicked aſſemblie <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> was accuſed, that he taught, that there <hi>was a fourth perſon beſides the trinity,</hi> and that he called <hi>Gregory</hi> a rymer, neither did it auaile him, that he denied theſe accuſations moſt conſtantly. for his accuſers were heard, and his defences little regarded. he was alſo moſt falſely charged with driuing the <hi>Germans</hi> out of the vniuerſity of <hi>Prague:</hi> wheras it was proued, that the <hi>Germans</hi> did voluntarily depart thence, for that they pretended their ancient priuiledges to be infringed.</p>
               <p>Againſt <hi>Bucer</hi> they giue out, that dying he turned Iew; and blaſphemed the name of Chriſt. a matter deuiſed without proofe or probability, and conuinced by all that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with him at his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grineus</hi> was preſent at the end of <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he died moſt quietly, godlie and chriſtianlie. and with him concurreth <hi>Wolfangus Capito.</hi> yet are not the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts aſhamed to giue foorth, that the Diuell ſt angled him. of whom I would but aske only one queſtion, to wit, who theſe witneſſes were, that ſaw the Diuell committing this act?</p>
               <p>Our Engliſh Papiſts ſeeke matter to obiect againſt biſhop Iewell of reuerend memory, but finde none. only they tell vs diuers falſe allegations are found in his bookes. but all their accuſations are anſwered, and reſt ſo without replie,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18506:139"/>although the ſhameleſſe aduerſaries deſiſt not to alledge matters diuers times anſwered. they ſaie further, that <hi>D. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens, and William Raynolds were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to Popery by reading his bookes.</hi> but the firſt was a ſimple fellow, and drawne away with hope, the ſecond ranne away forced by deſpaire.</p>
               <p>Againſt Biſhop <hi>Granmer</hi> they haue deniſed diuers ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous tales, as if he were vnlearned, inconſtant, and caried about his wiſe in a tronke. but for the firſt his learned wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and diſputes wil teſtifie, that it is vntruth. furthermore, very vnlike it is, that he ſhould haue beene emploied in ſo great affaires, if he had not beene ſingularly learned. his conſtancy appeareth in his continuall trauailes againſt the Popes authority and Popiſh errors. the laſt is an improbable tale deuiſed by ſome ſtandrous Popiſh paraſite. and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue they to be caſed in cloke-bagges, that doe beleeue it. for he had ſent his wife away before into <hi>Germany.</hi> and had he not, yet this deuiſe is improbable, if not impoſſible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sanders, Riſhton, Stapleton, Parſons,</hi> and their pewfellows haue publiſhed diuers ſlanders againſt <hi>king Henry the eight, Queene Elizabeth</hi> of bleſſed memory, and diuers of their loyall ſubiects. but it is not to be maruelled, if fugitiues and traytors raile againſt their Princes, and all that fauour the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The vnwritten traditions of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> are nothing but lies deuiſed, and falſely fathered vpon the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and their ſucceſſors. <hi>Bellarmine de verb. dei lib.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 3. eſteemeth the canon of the Maſſe to be a tradition. yet was the ſame deniſed ſince the Apoſtles times. and is not found in that forme of Maſſe, which is in the old Romiſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall. in the Apoſtles time certes Chriſtians neither praied for Popes, nor for Emperors. nor did <hi>Coſmas</hi> and <hi>Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and other Saints, mentioned in the canons, liue in the times of the Apoſtles, or their next ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Innocent the third c. cum Marthae. de celebratione miſſar.</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth, that theſe words of the canon, <hi>tum leuauit oculos in caelum ad patrem,</hi> and <hi>myſterium ſidei,</hi> and ſuch like not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the goſpell, are receined from Chriſt by tradition.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18506:139"/>but of his aſſertion he alledgeth no proofe. neither can he ſhew reaſon, why Chriſt ſhould omitte words now reputed ſo neceſſary.</p>
               <p>The worſhip of Images in the ſecond councell of <hi>Nice</hi> is called an Apoſtolike tradition. yet neuer doe we reade, that any Apoſtle, or Apoſtolike man did teach it. Naie the law of God doth expreſſely forbid the making of all Images or ſimilitudes, to the end they ſhould be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, that praiers and ſacrifices for the dead are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Apoſtolike traditions. yet our Sauiour ſheweth, that we are to worke, while we haue light, and appointed the euchariſt to be receiued of the communicants, and not to be offered for quicke and dead.</p>
               <p>The kiſſing of the altar, and bleſſing of incenſe, Maſſe-prieſts doe beleeue to be commanded by tradition. from the ſame founteine doe iſſue the waſhings of hands, turnings of the Prieſt, the ſwinging of the chalice here and there, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the hoſt, the pompous perambulation of the hoſt in the pixe, and other ceremonies of the maſſe. but theſe traditions are founded vpon lies and fables, and are partly Iewiſh, partly Heatheniſh, and all of them mere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuentions and deuiſes. nay ſom of them are fond and rediculous, as the kiſſing of ſtones and ſtocks; ſome repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſcriptures, as the adoration of the ſacrament, with that honour, that is due to God.</p>
               <p>In the miſſall ſalt is exorciſed <hi>for the ſaluation of ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,</hi> and water is hallowed <hi>for the driuing away of the power of the enemy.</hi> for the ſame end alſo candles are bleſſed. but that theſe creatures haue theſe effects, we doe not learne, but out of lying traditions, and the authors of them.</p>
               <p>From traditions alſo the biſhops ſuffragan doth challenge power to baptize belles. and belles ſo baptized ſay they, doe driue away diuels. this is recorded by <hi>Martinus de Arles tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat. de ſuperſtit. numer.</hi> 3.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. and of this abuſe the <hi>Germans</hi> complaine in their greeuances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> as the Papiſts feine, <hi>doth purge ſinnes as well, as the blood of Chriſt.</hi> but this is a lying tradition, and contrary
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18506:140"/>to ſcripture. for there we learne that ſinnes are purged not by lambes of waxe, but by the blood of Chriſt, the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat lambe, that taketh away the ſinnes of the world.</p>
               <p>Such are alſo the reſt of thoſe <hi>Romiſh</hi> traditions, which the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> maketh equall to holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>The legendes conteine more lies then leaues. for proofe I reporte me to the legendes of <hi>S. George, S. Chriſtopher, S. Catherin, S. Margaret,</hi> and the reſt. <hi>S. George</hi> bad the Kings daughter of <hi>Silena</hi> to caſt her girdle about the Dragons necke. which ſhe did, and the dragon followed her like a gentle dog. <hi>ſequebatur eam, velut manſuetiſſmus canis.</hi> when S. <hi>George</hi> was put into a frying pan full of boiling lead, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſigne of the croſſe, <hi>he was therein refreſhed, as if he had beene in a bath. coepit in eo quaſi in balneo refoueri.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Catherine</hi> King <hi>Coſtus</hi> his daughter, being but 18. yeares of age is ſaid to haue beene learned in all liberall ſciences. in the legend alſo we read, how <hi>Maxentius</hi> the emperor would haue forced her to ſacrifice to the Gods, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe prepared a wheele, which was turned by an Angel with ſuch violence, that it killed 4000. gentiles. it is ſaid alſo, that ſhe conuerted the Empres, and one of the Emperors cheefe capteines called <hi>Porphyrius.</hi> matters contrarie to all ſtories, and not only not ſpoken of in hiſtories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>S. Margaret</hi> was ſwallowed of the diuell in the figure of a <hi>Dragon.</hi> but making the ſigne of the croſſe the <hi>Dragon</hi> burſt, and out came <hi>S.

               <p>
                  <hi>Speculum exemplorum diſt.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 41. telleth how frier <hi>Leo</hi> ſaw two ladders reaching from the earth to heauen, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſate at the toppe of the one, and threw downe all the Friers, that came that way, but that our lady, that ſate at the toppe of the other, receiued all that came that way.</p>

               <p>Thus the Papiſts can confirme any point of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctirne with leaſings. infinite ſuch like leaſings are conteined in the legendes.</p>
               <p>The miracles reported in the legendes are nothing but miraculous lies.</p>

Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whom they cannot abuſe with lies, and falſe allegations, the Pope and his complices ſeek cruelly to deſtroy with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghoſt <hi>Apocalypſ.</hi> 17. ſheweth vs, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoore ſhould be <hi>drunke with the blood of the ſaints.</hi> and <hi>Apocalyp.</hi> 13. that the 2. beaſt ſhould kill ſuch, <hi>as would not worſhip the image of the beaſt,</hi> that is, that the Pope ſhould perſecute to the death ſuch as would not ſubmitte them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the kingdome of Antichriſt, in which the image of the Roman Empire was after a ſort reuiued. and this wee ſee verified by experience in the cruell gouernement of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents.</p>
               <p>Their lawes againſt all ſuch as diſſent from them in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the ſacraments are moſt rigorous. they are degraded, and deliuered ouer to the ſecular power to be burned, as it appeareth by the law <hi>ad abolendam. de haereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</hi> nay they puniſh ſuch as are ſuſpected, if they cannot cleere themſelues, with no leſſe rigor then the reſt. all that communicat with them, receiue them, or ſuccor them, are in great danger. ſuch as giue them counſell are reputed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, as is determined <hi>c. ſi aduerſus. de haereticis.</hi> the goods of heretikes are adiudged confiſcate. neither are they puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed only while they liue, but alſo after their death, being depriued of the communion of Chriſtians, and of buriall. <hi>Alexander the</hi> 4. <hi>c. quicunque haereticos. de haereticis</hi> in 6. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicateth, and depriueth of Chriſtian buriall all ſuch, <hi>as goe about to bury heretikes, or their fauorers.</hi> neither doe they admitte the repentance of ſuch as are adiudged relapſed, but deliuer them ouer to be burnt by their executioners, as we may reade in the chapter <hi>ſuper co. de haereticis. in</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>The ſpaniſh inquiſition is yet more rigorous, then the former laws of Popes. for vpon any wicked or lewd fellowes accuſation an honeſt man may be attached, impriſoned, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured,

               <p>In <hi>France</hi> they conſpired againſt the king, and bound themſelues by oath to exclude the houſe of <hi>Bourbon</hi> from the right of the crowne, and to roote out all that ſhould ſpeake againſt the Pope, &amp; his erroneous doctrine, and for that cauſe raiſed great tumults and ſtirres, as we may reade in the memorials of the league.</p>
               <p>The like courſe for many yeeres haue they taken in the Low countries, where the ſtrength of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> hath beene conſumed, and a way made for the good ſucceſſe of the common enemy of Chriſtendome the <hi>Turke.</hi>

               <p>Finally the Popes and their emiſſaries the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> doe delight in nothing more then in tumults, warres, ſeditions, maſſacring, and ſhedding of the blood of innocent Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The maſſacre of <hi>Paris</hi> is painted in the Popes palace, as

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> of late, perceiuing themſelues to be too weak to preuaile by plaine force, certaine vndermining Papiſts ſet on and reſolued by fiery <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and murdrous Maſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts, conceiued ſuch a treaſon, as ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be ſampled by any former precedent, nor found deſcribed in any old or new hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. their intention was at one inſtant with fire and gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder to conſume the King, the Queene, the Prince, the Prelates of the Church, the Nobles, Knights, and Burgeſſes of the realme, the Iudges and all that attended the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble court of Parliament. nay not content herewith they had a further practiſe to deſtroy the Kings roiall lignage, to maſſacre all the profeſſors of religion throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to deliuer their country as a praie into the hands of Strangers. The principall actors were <hi>Thomas Percy, Cateſby</hi> and <hi>Fauxe:</hi> the principall counſellors <hi>Garnet, Hall, Baldwin,</hi> and diuers other of the damned crew of Iebuſites; their aiders the damned crew of reconciled recuſants.</p>
               <p>Can we then thinke theſe men to belong to <hi>Chriſts</hi> flocke, that vſe this woluiſh cruelty? <hi>longè diuerſaſunt carniſicina &amp; pietas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lactantius, nec poteſt aut veritas cum vi, aut inſtitia
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18506:145"/>cum crudelitate coniungi.</hi> that is, <hi>piety and butcherly cruelty are two diuers things, and neither can truth with force, nor iuſtice be coupled with crueltie. Matthew Paris</hi> ſheweth, that in the times of <hi>Innocent the third,</hi> Chriſtians were accuſed by a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſent from heauen for <hi>ſhewing no pity vpon widowes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, and ſhewing leſſe mercy, then did the pagans. viduae &amp; orphani ad vos clamant quotidie,</hi> ſaith that writing, <hi>quibus nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam facitis miſcricordiam. pagani habent miſericordiam, at vos non habetis.</hi> but much more reaſon haue we to vſe theſe words to the moderne <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and their complices. for they are more mercileſſe then <hi>Turkes.</hi> the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſuffer Chriſtians to inioy their religion, and theſe doe not. therefore the <hi>Italians,</hi> as <hi>Natalis Comes</hi> in his hiſtory teſtifieth, ſay, <hi>it is better to liue vnder the Turke, then vnder the Spaniards and Popes inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> and for this cauſe the kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Tranſiluania</hi> hath choſen rather to ſeeke for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor at the hands of <hi>Turkes,</hi> then to endure the cruell and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous executions of the Pope, and his bloody inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. vp then o Lord and ſcatter theſe thy bloody enemies, that ſeeke to ſcatter and maſſacre the ſheepe of thy paſture, and let not thoſe preuaile any further, that make warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lambe, and all that follow him, and conſtantlie profeſſe his truth theſe wolues haue conſpired and ſworne the deſtruction of the profeſſors of religion. At <hi>Bayon anno</hi> 1585. a league was concluded betwixt <hi>France, Spaine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes. the articles were theſe, as is euident by the <hi>French</hi> hiſtories. <hi>The Spaniſh king ſhall warre vpon the king of Nauarre. the dukes of Ferraria and Sauoy with the aid of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man horſemen ſhall tranſlate the wars into France. the Germans ſhall hinder all ſuccor to come to them of the religion. the Cantons of Suizzerland, that adhere to the Pope, ſhall oppreſſe the other Cantons. Monkes ſhall giue their names for ſouldiers. and all ſhall endeuor to kill the Lutherans.</hi> ſo you ſee, that the finall end of their deſignes is murder and cruelty. their meanes, fire, ſword and gunpowder their contentment waſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>What reaſon then haue Chriſtians to ſlugge and ſleepe
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18506:145"/>when danger is ſo neere them? doe they thinke, that papiſts want gun powder, or poiſon, or that they wil not hurt if they recouer ſtrength? as well they may thinke, that wolues wil ceaſe from crueltie, and Serpents caſt away their poiſon, and tyrants prooue gentle foſter fathers, and <hi>Turkes</hi> turne Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Nay ſuch Princes as are not Papiſts, are not much to truſt them, if they ſatisfie not the Popes will in all things. <hi>Gregory the</hi> 7. killed and empoiſoned all, that were oppoſite to his deſeings. he excommunicated the emperor <hi>Henry the fourth,</hi> becauſe he would not ſuffer him quietly to ſell eccleſiaſticall prelacies. his ſucceſſors made warres vpon <hi>Henry the ſift, Fridericke the</hi> 1. <hi>Philip, Otho</hi> and <hi>Fridericke the</hi> 2. for that they could not bee ſuffered to diſpoſe of the landes of the Empire. <hi>Lewis of Bauier</hi> was perſecuted for no other cauſe, then for that he would not receiue his crowne at the Popes hands. for this cauſe alſo <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> became e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the Clergy, becauſe he tooke the crowne, before it was deliuered by Popiſh prelates. <hi>Philip the faire</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8. for that he would not acknowledge himſelfe to be the Popes ſubiect. and yet did they not know any other religion, then that, which the Pope then profeſſed.</p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Henry the</hi> 3. of <hi>France,</hi> albeit ſuperſtitiouſly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to popery, yet could he not eſcape the butcherly hands of the popiſh leaguers, that ſuborned a Dominican Frier to kill him, for that he would not at their appointment make warres vpon his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore this point, there is no way of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for Chriſtians againſt the Popes cruelty and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents practiſes, then manfully to reſiſt their vſurpations, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to take heede of their mines and gunpowder, and neuer to truſt their ſweete words and guilefull promiſes. with cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency they are not to bee mitigated; but with reſolution and iuſtice they may eaſily be ſubdued.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond went one point further, and diſputed, <hi>that the church was not bound with othes,</hi> as <hi>Guicciardine</hi> in his hiſtorie reporteth. now euery man knoweth, that by the church he vnderſtood the Pope.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> for this perſidious dealing of the Popes complices would not come to the councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> without good pledges.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander the</hi> 6. was more perfidious, then any Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, as in his life <hi>Onuphrius</hi> teſtifieth. <hi>perfidia plus quàm punica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Iulius the third</hi> was in petition, he ſwore both to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> as is teſtified in <hi>Pelegrino Ingleſe,</hi> but performed neither to the one nor to the other.</p>
               <p>The Maſſe-prieſts of <hi>Trent</hi> promiſed ſafeconduct to all that would come to <hi>Trent.</hi> but contrary to the ſame, <hi>Verge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and others were excluded out of the ſynod, and diuers doctors comming out of <hi>Germany,</hi> could not be heard to diſpute, and hardly eſcaped with their liues out of the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles the</hi> 9. of <hi>France, anno</hi> 1572. with monſtrous oaths and ſolemne promiſes, drew the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the admirall and many other noble-men and gentle-men vnto <hi>Paris.</hi> but it coſt them full deare, and loſt them all their beſt men. for there that noble Queene was poiſoned, there the king of <hi>Nauarre</hi> was taken priſoner, and the reſt trecherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdred. and ſo farre was the Pope from condemning this fact, that he cauſed the ſame to be ſet out in tables in
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18506:147"/>his pallace among the triumphant acts of Popes.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flandres</hi> vpon ſurrenders of townes ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome did our aduerſaries regard either oath, or promiſe. diuers edicts haue beene publiſhed by the <hi>French</hi> king for the pacification of troubles, but they prooued nothing, but traps and engins to take men, that ment ſimply and plainly. the capitulation with them of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> was megerly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. The duke of <hi>Alua</hi> and his complices contrary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe murdred the garriſon of <hi>Arlem, Narden, Zutphen,</hi> and diuers other townes.</p>
               <p>Of late we thought our ſelues ſecure, hauing peace with all the world. but euen then we were neereſt danger, and could not haue eſcaped it, if God had not diſcouered the mine, the powder, the traine, and the whole packe of tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1588. while the agents of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were treating of peace, the enemies came vpon vs, hoping ſodenly to ouer-whelme vs with warres being taken vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided.</p>
               <p>No treatie could be more ſolemnly agreed vpon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, then the pacification of <hi>Gant,</hi> after the ſurpriſe of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> yet was neither promiſe nor oath kept therein; but rather vnder confidence of theſe promiſes and oathes, many poore people were ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Firſt then wee ſay, that our hope is, that <hi>God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them that ſpeake lies,</hi> and not <hi>hold them guiltleſſe,</hi> that ſhall ſweare falſly, diſhonoring his holy name. this we are aſſured, that <hi>he abhorreth the bloody and deceitfull man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may rightly conclude, that ſuch as looke for performance of oathes and promiſes at the hands of the Pope and his complices, further then neceſſitie and profit vrgeth them; are verie ignorant of their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes. we may ſay alſo, that they are very weake and ſimple. for once any plaine dealing man may be abuſed. but to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend diuers times in one fault, and oftentimes to runne into the ſame trap, argueth great weakeneſſe, negligence and wilfulneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:18506:147"/>
               <p>Finally albeit princes, that liue vnder the Popes lawes were willing to keepe touch, and to performe promiſes; yet we muſt remember, how eaſily the Pope diſpenſeth with oathes, and how neceſſary it is for them to breake all coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, if the Pope once declare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary party to be an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, or ſchiſmatike. In the <hi>Clementine Romam. de iureiuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> the Popes forbid all princes <hi>vnionem, parentelam, confoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derationem,</hi> that is, <hi>peace, contracting of alliance, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> with ſuch, as are their enemies. and if any contract be made, then muſt the ſame be diſſolued vpon paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when the Pope pleaſeth. ſo all the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that Chriſtians can haue of amitie with the Popes vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, dependeth on the Popes pleaſure, and his pleaſure is founded vpon his profit, and neceſſitie: and our ſecuritie ſtandeth in watching their mines and gunpowder treaſons. God grant therefore all Chriſtians grace to beware, that they be not entrapped with falſe and perfidious promiſes; nor vndermined with their ſubtilties, nor blowne vp with treaſon: and giue our aduerſaries that light of reaſon, that they may ſee, that oathes made by the name of God in iuſt and honeſt cauſes, are not to be diſſolued either by the Pope or any other, nor their treaſons to be warranted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Popiſh facultie.</p>

               <p>FAithfull Chriſtians and the citizens of the city of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>are built vpon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus Christ being the chiefe corner ſtone.</hi> but our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt</hi> was an high prieſt, <hi>moſt holy, innocent, and vnderſiled.</hi> and his Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were holy men, and endued with ſpeciall graces fit for that function. let vs then ſee what manner of men the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:18506:148"/>firſt authors and principall vpholders of Popery haue bene, that by the different qualities of the one and the other, we may the better eſteeme of true religion, and more perfectly learne to hate the ſuperſtition, hereſie, tyranny, and all the abhominations of the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their wicked faction.</p>
               <p>The myſtery of iniquity beganne to worke in the Apoſtles time, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> teſtifieth. for then falſe teachers beganne to ſpread their poiſon, and after the departure of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, rauening wolues <hi>entred into the Church not ſparing the ſtocke.</hi> by little and little alſo heatheniſh and Iewiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies began to be receiued in diuers places, and as <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>the world grew full of preſumptions.</hi> but Antichriſt began not to ſhew himſelfe openly before the times of <hi>Phocas</hi> the emperor, who at the erneſt ſolicitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of<note n="a" place="margin">Platina in Bonifacio <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Boniface the third</hi> granted, that the church of <hi>Rome ſhould be called and accounted the head of other Churches.</hi> ſo then the principall agent in the erection of the papacy was <hi>Phocas,</hi> a barbarous <hi>Thracian</hi> by nation, and a common ſoldier, by tumult ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced to the empire, and one that began his reigne with the ſlaughter of his maſter, of the Empreſſe, and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>The next was <hi>Irene</hi> a proud inſolent and cruell woman, that among others, murdred her owne ſonne. for vnto her time the worſhip of God continued in the church of Rome without any notable corruption. but ſhe with the helpe of <hi>Adrian</hi> Biſhop of Rome, and other ſuperſtitious perſons firſt brought in the idolatrous worſhip of images and Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gregory the</hi> 7. was the firſt, that by force diſſolued Prieſts mariages, and exalted the miter of the Pope aboue the crownes of emperors and kings, taking vpon him firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them from their ſeats. but among all the Popes you ſhall not finde any more abominable. <hi>Beno</hi> teſtifieth he was <hi>a necromancer, a murderer, an empoyſoner,</hi> and a <hi>ſacrilegious and impious perſon.</hi> the ſynode of <hi>Brixina</hi> condemned him for diuers abominable crimes. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> in <hi>Willelmo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaſtore</hi> writeth, that being readie to depart this life, he
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18506:148"/>confeſſed, <hi>that by the Diuels perſwaſion he had prouoked the wrath of God againſt mankind.</hi> he threw the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into the fire, becauſe he could obteine no ſucch anſwere of it, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and liued ſcandalouſly with <hi>Mathilda.</hi> a fit fellow therefore he was to aduance the whoriſh, ſacrilegious and murdrous religion of the later <hi>Rome,</hi> that is ſo much dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paſchall the</hi> 2. that atchieued that, which <hi>Gregory the.</hi> 7. and others his prediceſſors had begun, was a periured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a firebrand of ſedition and trouble. he ſet the ſonne againſt the father, and the ſubiects againſt their princes. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing preuailed againſt the Emperor he would not ſuffer his body to be buried. and hauing gotten into his hands the bodie of <hi>Clement</hi> the Antipope he cauſed the ſame to bee burned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander the</hi> 3. a great patron of the Popes authoritie betraied the emperor <hi>Friderike Barbaroſſa</hi> to the ſoldan, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his liuely portrait vnto him, and perſwading him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him. he trode moſt proudly vpon the Emperors neck, and abuſed wordes of ſcripture moſt impiouſlie to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Innocent the third,</hi> that firſt eſtabliſhed auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and tranſubſtantiation, two principall bulwarks of the Popes kingdome, and was a principall doer in the decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tales, raiſed bloody warres againſt the Chriſtians in <hi>France,</hi> that would not allow his authority, cauſed the bones of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericus</hi> to be burned, for that he had preached againſt the worſhip of Images, and ſhewed himſelfe a bloody wolf and a deuourer of Chriſts flocke, and an impure fellow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Cantipratenſis</hi> a Dominican Frier reporteth, that this <hi>Innocent</hi> after his death appeared to <hi>S. Luitgard,</hi> all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Honorius the third,</hi> that firſt authorized the idolatrous worſhip of the Maſſe-cake, as appeareth by the chapter <hi>ſane cum olim. de celebrat. miſſar.</hi> was proud, cruell, vitious, and ſuperſtitious. he forbad honeſt mariage to Prieſts, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the filthy religion of Monkes and Friers. <hi>Dominike</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:18506:149"/>and <hi>Francis,</hi> and the locuſts, that came out of the bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pit of hell were firſt allowed by him. his malice and anger were ſhewed vpon the <hi>Scots,</hi> that had killed <hi>Adam</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Catneſſe.</hi> for he cauſed 400. to be hanged, among which many innocents were comprehended, and cauſed their children to bee gelded, that he might extinguiſh their race.</p>
               <p>But one of the principall builders of this Romiſh <hi>Babylon</hi> was <hi>Gregorie the</hi> 9. for he gathered the decretales of Popes together, and gaue then ferce of lawe, as appeareth by his preface before the decretales. ſome ſay, he was the coſin of <hi>Innocent the third.</hi> but his manners doe declare him rather to haue beene his ſonne. he excommunicated the Emperour <hi>Friderike,</hi> that warred vpon the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and ſtopped the good ſucceſſe, and the courſe of the victories of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt them. ſecretly he murdred the Emperors em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, publiſhed lying decretales againſt him, as we may read in <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> finally, to enrich his nephewes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his baſtards, he ſet all <hi>Italy</hi> on a flame.</p>

Villani</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in his chronicle teſtifieth, that he was a filthy fellow. for the wickedneſſe and abominable life of <hi>Iohn the</hi> 22. <hi>Petrarch</hi> made the ſonnet <hi>Fiammadal ciel:</hi> wherein he beſeecheth God, <hi>that ſlames from heauen might ſtreame down and conſume
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18506:149"/>the court of Rome.</hi> It greeued him not a little, that the Pope did keepe his ſiſter, hauing with a great price bought her of her brother <hi>Gerard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. by whoſe authority the councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was aſſembled, was conuinced to be <hi>an inceſtuous perſon, a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domite,</hi> and <hi>a moſt abominable atheiſt, denying the immortality of the ſoule,</hi> as appeareth by the acts of that councell, and the appendix. and yet this is the ſynode, that condemned the doctrine of <hi>M. Wickleſſe,</hi> and eſtabliſhed the communion vnder one kinde, and the ſubſiſtence of accidents without ſubſtance, and diuers other points of Popery.</p>
               <p>The councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> wherein the Popes ſupremacy, purgatory, and diuers points of popiſh doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſacrments were confirmed, had his ſtrength from <hi>Eugenius the fourth,</hi> that by the councell of <hi>Baſill</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an hereticke, and by the citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> driuen out of the city as a publike enemy. he was the cauſe of the periury of Ladiſlaus, that broke with the <hi>Turke,</hi> and of the defait and ſlaughter of the Chriſtians at <hi>Varna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The three principall authors of the wicked decrees, and anathematiſmes of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> were <hi>Paul the third, Inlius the third, and Pius the fourth:</hi> whereof the firſt was a parricide, a lechour, a necromancer and an empoyſoner, as is teſtified by <hi>Vergerius, Sleidan</hi> and other. <hi>Iulius the third</hi> was a ſenſuall epicure, and a filthy ſodomite, as is teſtified in a certaine preface before the ſtory of <hi>Iouius,</hi> and declared by certein rymes and verſes made vpon him, and <hi>Innocentius de Monte,</hi> a boy made Cardinall by him. <hi>Pius the fourth,</hi> as the common report went, died betwixt two concubines, and was infamous for lechery and villany, &amp; odious to the Romans for his vices.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake generally of later popes the only founders and belmelters of Popiſh religion, we finde, that they haue been the greateſt ſcandales of Chriſtian religion, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall authors of the calamities of Chriſtendome. <hi>Bernard in ſerm.</hi> 1. <hi>in conuerſ. S. Pauli</hi> complaineth, <hi>that iniquity taking his beginning from the Popes of his time, was ſpred out ouer the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18506:150"/>world. egreſſa est iniquitas,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>à ſenioribus iudicibus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carijs tuis, qui videntur regere populum tuum. Petrarke</hi> in his epiſtles without title, ſaith, <hi>the court of Rome was not a city, but a houſe full of diuels, and wicked ſpirits, and a ſinke of vice and ſhame. non ciuitas, ſed lemurum, &amp; laruarum domus, &amp; vt bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiter dicam, ſcelerum &amp; dedecorum omnium ſentina. Iohn of Sarisbury</hi> in <hi>Polycrat. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 24. ſaith, <hi>that Popes doe therefore die the faſter, leaſt they ſhould corrupt the whole church. ideo mea opinione papae frequentius moriuntur, ne totam corrumpant eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiam. Warnerus in Martino</hi> 2. <hi>Adriano</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Stephano,</hi> crieth out, <hi>heu, heu, quomodo obſcuratum eſt aurum! alas, alas, how is the golde obſcured!</hi> he compleineth alſo of the ſcandales, that happened in the papacy, and of <hi>their emulations, ſects, and contentions,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that truth failed among the children of men. Theodoric a Niem de ſchiſm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 42. ſaith, that ſo much iniquity was gone from the Popes, that <hi>the catholike faith was darkned thereby, and religion ſuffered ſhipwracke, and all vertues were departed from all ſorts of men, vt catholica fides obnubiletur, &amp; omnis religio naufragium patiatur, virtutes ab omnibus receſſerint. Platina in Sergio</hi> 3. ſaith, <hi>that Popes getting their places by bribery neglected Gods worſhip, and perſecuted their enemies like moſt cruell tyrantes, that afterward they might with more ſecurity ſatisfie their luſts, when there was none to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll them. Ioannes Marius de ſchiſm. part.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 5. teſtifieth, that all the euils of chriſtendome <hi>haue proceeded from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, ambition, and auarice of wicked Popes. a malitia, ambitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; auaritia ſceleratorum paparum omnia mala in mundo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniunt.

               <p>The chiefe mainteiners of Popery in our times, if we ſpeake of lay men, were <hi>Charles the</hi> 9. <hi>of France, Henry the</hi> 3. <hi>his brother, Philip the</hi> 2. <hi>of Spaine, the duke of Alua, the duke of Guiſe, and his brethren, the earle of Weſtmerland,</hi> the head of the rebellion in the North. but if we ſeeke all hiſtories, we ſhall hardly finde woorſe men. <hi>Charles the</hi> 9. was a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweater, a perfidious and licentious prince. <hi>Henry the</hi> 3. was ſuperſtitious and altogether giuen to carnall delights.

               <p>Is it not then a matter ridiculous, that Maſſe-prieſts ſhould ſo exceſſiuely commend this religion, that had ſuch founders and fauorers, as theſe are, and which, as we ſee, was inuented and confirmed by wicked men, and vpholden by fraude and force?</p>

               <p>THe impieties and abominations of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> religion are ſo many, that hardly can we recount them, and ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and horrible, that no Chriſtian can take pleaſure to heare them. and yet if we pleaſe to looke into the ſecret my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Popery, and to examine all the odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable doctrines of the Romiſh ſynagogue, we may well make queſtion, whether of the two religions deſerueth more to be abhorred and hated. for firſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> do ſpeake well of the law and the Prophets, and handle books of ſcriptures with great reuerence. <hi>Antonie Geoffrey</hi> in his 2. <hi>booke of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> ceremonies reporteth, how the <hi>Turkes</hi> accompt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels among holy ſcriptures. <hi>inter ſacras literas habent noſtra euangelia,</hi> ſaith he. but the Papiſts ſpeake euill of ſcriptures, and call them <hi>ſometimes a dead and killing letter,</hi> ſometimes <hi>a matter of ſtrife,</hi> ſometime a <hi>noſe of waxe.</hi> they doe alſo han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them very rudely, and without reſpect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi> they will not haue them to be authenticall in reſpect of vs, without the Popes conſignation and teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> neuer burned their <hi>Alchoran,</hi> or the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles vpon pretence of falſe tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:18506:151"/>but the Papiſts haue often times burned holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turs, as appeareth by the eccleſiaſticall hiſtories of <hi>France, England, Germany</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poſtell in</hi> his hiſtory of <hi>Turkes</hi> ſheweth, how they teach <hi>that perfection is conteined in the goſpell.</hi> and <hi>Gifford lib. Calui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noturciſ.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 9. confeſſeth, that they beleeue <hi>all religion to be therein conteined.</hi> but Papiſts doe rather hope to finde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the rules of Monkes and Friers, then in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and therefore accompt rather the ſtate of Monks to be a ſtate of perfection, then the liues of Chriſtians after the rule of the Goſpell. the Maſſe-prieſts of <hi>Trent</hi> doe make traditions equall to ſcriptures, and commonly they deny ſcriptures to be a perfect rule of life and doctrine.</p>
               <p>The doctors of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> religion were neuer ſo ſimple, as to thinke the traditions of their church to be equall to the <hi>Alchoran of Mahomet.</hi> But the Maſſe-prieſts of <hi>Trent</hi> will haue traditions not written, and holy ſcriptures <hi>to bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with equall affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such as blaſpheme Chriſt, are puniſhed by the <hi>Turkes</hi> moſt ſeuerely. but Papiſts teare him in pieces with their blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, and ſuch are thought to be moſt cleare of hereſie, which ſweare moſt wickedly, and blaſphemouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auerroes</hi> of all religions accompteth Popery to bee moſt abſurd, for that Papiſts worſhip a peece of a Maſſe-cake for their God, and yet preſently deuoure him, and ſwallow him downe into their bellies.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Turkes</hi> euer allowed the eating of mans fleſh, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that it were poſſible for a man to ſwallow downe a whole and perfect man without hurt, or diminution, or bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his body. but Papiſts make their followers eaters of mans fleſh, and ſay, that euery one eating the ſacrament doth eate vp Chriſts body whole and entire, and yet beleeue that they neither breake his fleſh, nor digeſt it.</p>
               <p>Euery <hi>Mahometan,</hi> albeit he beleeueth not Chriſt to be God, yet would be aſhamed to ſay, that doggs and hogges and other brute beaſts may eate Chriſts body. but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, albeit according to the Chriſtian faith they profeſſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18506:152"/>Chriſt to be true God, yet they teach, that dogges and hogges doe eat his body, as ofte as they eate conſecrated hoſts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Prieſts beleeue, that Chriſt was true man, &amp; that his body is viſible and palpable. but the Maſſe-prieſts giue him a body in the ſacrament, that is neither viſible, nor palpable, nor in any reſpect like to our bodies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> doe teach, that after this life ſome are placed in paradiſe, ſome damned to hell, as <hi>Poſtell</hi> writeth in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Turkes:</hi> a third place they know not, nor doe they beleeue, that their <hi>Calipha</hi> or high Prieſt is able to deliuer ſoules out of the nether part of the earth by his indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. but the Papiſts beleeue a third place beſide heauen, and the place of the damned, and ſuppoſe that the Pope is ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne lord of purgatory, and can deliuer ſoules thence by his indulgences.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Turkes</hi> we doe not read of anie, that euer doubted of the immortality of the ſoule, as <hi>Menauinus de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig. Turc. teſtifieth.</hi> but among the Papiſts many doubt of it. for elſe why ſhould <hi>Leo the x. lateran. concil. ſeſſ.</hi> 8. forbid men to diſpute againſt the immortality of the ſoule? ſome deny it, as did <hi>Iohn the</hi> 23. as is teſtified in the appendix to the councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and many other atheiſticall Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who haue nothing of religion, but an outward bare profeſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Turkes</hi> do beleeue, that God hath a body. yet doe they not ſuffer any image or ſimilitude of God to be made. but Papiſts albeit they profeſſe God to be a ſpirit, yet moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdlie they doe make diuers corporeall Images of God.</p>
               <p>The law of God prohibiting the making and worſhip of grauen images and other likeneſſes, is diligently obſerued of <hi>Turkes. Georgeuitz in his booke de moribus Turcarum</hi> ſaith, he <hi>neuer ſaw any images in the temples of Turkes.</hi> with him alſo in effect concurreth <hi>Zigabenus</hi> in <hi>elencho Iſmaelit.</hi> and ſheweth, that ſuch as worſhip images by the <hi>Turks</hi> are called idolaters. but Papiſts fill al the corners of their churches ful of images, and idolatrouſly doe they worſhip them. nay becauſe they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18506:152"/>perceiue their practiſe to be contrariant to the law of God, therefore in their briefe catechiſmes they raze out the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement againſt images.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> neuer called himſelfe God, but the Prophet of god only. neither did his followers euer giue him the title or honor of God. nay ſome of them beleeue, that <hi>Coſdroes</hi> was vanquiſhed by the romans, becauſe he called himſelfe God. but Papiſts call the Pope God, as we read in <hi>Baldus in c. vlt. cod. ſent. reſcind.</hi> and the Pope calleth himſelfe God after a cunning ſort <hi>c. ſatis. diſt.</hi> 96.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> are not ſo abſurd, as to beleeue, that their <hi>Calipha, Mufti,</hi> or high Prieſt cannot erre, becauſe he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and ſitteth in his chaire. but the ſimple Papiſts moſt abſurdly thinke, that their Pope, albeit he bee ignorant and fooliſh, yet cannot erre, as long as he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of the papall chaire. In all the hiſtories of <hi>Turkes</hi> we cannot finde, where any <hi>Ianizars</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Friers thought it lawfull, or attempted to blow vp the <hi>Turkes</hi> pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or parliament houſe. but <hi>Thomas Percy, Catesby</hi> and their conſorts attempted and thought it lawfull to blow vp the parliament houſe, the king and principall men of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. the Papiſts therfore paſſe <hi>Turkes</hi> in barbarous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious cruelty.</p>
               <p>We do not reade, that any <hi>Calipha</hi> of the <hi>Turkes</hi> did skin any of his Prieſts. but <hi>Iohn the</hi> 22. as <hi>Platina</hi> recordeth, did pull the skinne from the Biſhop of <hi>Cahors.</hi> happy had he beene, if his body had beene inuiſible and impalpable, as the Papiſts make Chriſts imaginary body in the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as <hi>Zigabenus</hi> in <hi>Saracenicis</hi> telleth vs, wrote only 113. fables. but the Papiſts in their legends, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiaries, and <hi>Caeſar Fabulonius,</hi> I would ſay <hi>Baronius,</hi> haue written more then x. M. fables, and commend to their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers moſt fabulous fooleries.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Turkes</hi> the Prieſts may not begge. but the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and other mendicant Friers count beggery a peece of perfection. and much it were to be wiſhed, that they did
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:18506:153"/>only begge. for oftentimes they either take by force, or ſteale moſt cunningly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Septemcaſtrenſis de relig. Turc. c.</hi> 14. teſtifieth that the <hi>Turkes</hi> in their faſts abſtaine from all meat and drinke. doth it not then appeare, that they faſt better then Papiſts, that drinke wine and eate all dainty fiſhes and banketting meats, vpon their faſting daies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> doe not beleeue their religion to be true, or their <hi>Alcoran</hi> to beſcripture, becauſe their <hi>Calipha</hi> doth tell them; but becauſe they take it, to haue come from God. but the Papiſts neither beleeue ſcriptures, nor the articles of faith, vnleſſe the Pope doth particularly tell them, that the ſcriptures came from God, and that their Chriſtian faith is Apoſtolicall and moſt true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> beleeue not, that any can be iuſtified by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme vnction, or eating red-herrings and ſalt-fiſh. but the Papiſts both teach it, and beleeue it, and burne all that ſhall hold, beleeue or teach the contrary.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turkes</hi> albeit ſeruile in their manner of life, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kiſſe the feete of their <hi>Calipha,</hi> nor heaue him vp to be adored by his followers are not then the papiſts in this point more ſlauiſh and miſerable, then the Mahometans?</p>
               <p>Finally <hi>Mahomet</hi> neuer taught his followers to kill Kings excommunicated by the chiefe Prieſt of <hi>Turkes,</hi> or to rebell or take armes againſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> or Emperor of <hi>Saracens,</hi> as oft as their chiefe prieſt ſhould command them. nor did he teach his followers, that the <hi>Calipha of Turkes</hi> could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with the law of God, or aſſoile ſubiects from their oathes made to princes. but the Popes baſtardly children the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> doe giue all this power to their holy father, and he is nothing nice in taking it vpon him. and ſo farre haue they proceeded in this damnable doctrin, that no prince can ſtand aſſured of his life, that hath any of this generation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. this doctrine coſt <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> and the prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> their liues, and put both <hi>Henry the</hi> 8. <hi>of England,</hi> and his daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and <hi>Henry the</hi> 4. <hi>of France</hi> to their plunges, and brought them into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:18506:153"/>And of late time the King, the Queene, their children, the Nobles, and prelates of <hi>England</hi> and the Commons aſſembled in parliament were deſeined to the ſlaughter, and had beene deſtroied, if God had not diſcouered the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
               <p>Were Chriſtians then ſo patient, as to tolerate hereſie; yet it argueth great ſtupidity, if they ſhould endure a religion more abſurd, fooliſh, and abominable then Mahometrie.</p>

               <p>For firſt the <hi>Turke</hi> forceth none to imbrace his religion, nor puniſheth any for profeſſing other religions. but the Pope and his faction in <hi>France, Flanders</hi> and other countries vſeth all manner of enforcement to drawe men to Popiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and puniſheth with all ſeuerity ſuch, as be contrary to him.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Mahomet</hi> commanded his diſciples to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to Chriſtians, if they deſired it, as <hi>Zigabenus</hi> ſaith in <hi>Saracenicis.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. but the Papiſts admitte no leagues, or treatie, or pacification with the true profeſſors of religion, but ſeeke their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whenſoeuer they can preuaile againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:18506:154"/>
               <p>Thirdly <hi>Turkes</hi> haue no inquiſitors, nor rackes or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſuch, as hold Chriſtian religion, but ſuffer them quietly, if they be not tumultuous and troubleſome to the ſtate. but the Pope &amp; his complices ſearch out poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by their inquiſitors, that haue as good ſent, as bloud hounds, and ſuffer them not to hide themſelues either in woods, holes or deſerts. and ſuch as they finde they racke and torment, and ſome they poiſon, ſome they famiſh, ſome they burne, by all meanes purpoſing to deſtroy the race of their aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>Fourthly <hi>Turkes</hi> doe not vſe to maſſacre Chriſtians, or to murder them without ſentence of Law, and lawfull procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. but the barbarous and bloody executioners of the Pope in <hi>France</hi> at diuers times haue maſſacred many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of harmeleſſe and diſarmed Chriſtians, killing them neither by lawfull warre, nor by any forme of iuſtice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Commonly the <hi>Turkes</hi> hauing vanquiſhed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, doe ſpare ſuch as yeeld, and take them captiues, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is it ſeene, that they kill women and children. but <hi>the Papiſts in France</hi> maſſacred men, women, and children, &amp; like fierce woolues haue ſought the blood of all manner of Chriſtians oppoſite to them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the Turkes dominions Chriſtians are burdened with tribute, but paying the ſame they are quit. but that is nothing to the oppreſſions of <hi>Christians</hi> vnder the Pope, and his vaſſals. for there they pay both to the Prince and to the Pope. and neither are they free aliue or dead from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Maſſe-prieſts. but if any Chriſtian differ from them in matters of faith, no tribute can acquite him ſo, but his goods are confiſcate, and his perſon ſeaſed. and this is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent both by the chap. <hi>vergentis. de haereticis.</hi> and by their common practiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Turkes deale not ſo perfidiouſly with Chriſtians, as doe the Papiſts. they empoiſon not men by trechery, nor commonly breake ſolemne oathes and promiſes. but the Popes and their complices teach their followers to keepe no faith with ſuch Chriſtians, as they cal heretikes. nay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:18506:154"/>they bee excommunicate or no they reſpect not, but murder all that are oppoſite to them, if they can, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their late bloody practiſe againſt the King and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Laſtly the Papiſts doe prohibite buriall to Chriſtians, as appeareth by the chapter <hi>ſicut. de baereticis.</hi> they iudge them alſo being dead, and digge them out of their graues, and burne their bodies. and ſo they dealt with <hi>Wickleffe, Bucer</hi> and <hi>Phagius</hi> in England, and with <hi>Almaricus</hi> and others in other places. but this inhumanity the <hi>Turkes</hi> will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to practiſe againſt their greateſt enemies.</p>
               <p>What Chriſtian then, that is not paſt all feeling, will not abhor this inhumanity, &amp; more then Turkiſh crueltie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that neither dead nor aliue can endure true Chriſtians?</p>

               <p>AS the ſtrength of the <hi>Roman</hi> empire was the bulwarke, that kept off the <hi>Turke,</hi> and other barbarous nations, from the inuaſion of Chriſtendome, and the moſt potent meanes, to vnite Chriſtians in the common defence of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike religion, and to defend thoſe countries, that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it; ſo it is apparent, that thoſe, that haue weakened the Emperours, and cauſed diniſion among Chriſtian princes, haue alſo giuen way to the conqueſts of Turkes, and decaied the ſtrength of Chriſtians. but no man needeth to doubt, but that the Popes aboue al men in the world haue through their ambition, contention, and tumultuous practiſes both ruinated the Empire, and ſet Chriſtians at contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:18506:155"/>
               <p>For firſt the ſpirit of God <hi>Apocalyp.</hi> 13. ſheweth, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt figured by a lamberiſing out of the earth and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a dragon, ſhould ſucceed the Emperour, and after a ſort repaire the empire figured by the beaſt like a leopard, that roſe out of the ſea. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>he did all the first beast could doe.</hi> he alſo <hi>cauſed the earth to worſhip the first beast, whoſe deadly wound was healed.</hi> all which is perfectly fulfilled in the Pope. for he poſſeſſeth <hi>Rome,</hi> and although he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter;</hi> yet taketh he vpon him to manage both the ſwords. he alſo healed the wound that <hi>Rome</hi> receiued by the decay of the Empire, making all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to worſhip the Roman See, and calling his followers <hi>Roman</hi> catholikes.</p>
               <p>Further the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. declareth, that one thing did withhold the comming of Antichriſt, which through the working of the myſtery of iniquity was then approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that <hi>Ambroſe, Hierome,</hi> and other fathers doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret of the <hi>Romane</hi> empire. ſo we ſee ſtill an oppoſition betwixt the Roman Empire, and the kingdome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and that the decay of the one, ſhould be the riſing of the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we ſee by practiſe, that the Popes by all meanes haue gone about to diuide, and to weaken the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. for firſt vnder colour of the contention about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images they cauſed <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> to rebell againſt the Emperors of the Eaſt, as we may read in the hiſtories concerning <hi>Leo Iſauricus,</hi> &amp; diuers that ſucceeded him. next they brought the <hi>Gaules</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and diminiſhed the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, diuiding as much, as in them lay, the Weſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eaſt, and confirming the right of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, but alwaies keeping <hi>Rome,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Italy</hi> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Afterward hauing preuailed againſt the Eaſterne Emperors, they ſet vpon the Emperors of the Weſt, and by ſetting the ſubiects againſt their kings, and the ſonnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fathers by their anathematiſmes and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, they haue brought the Emperors to that paſſe, that they receiue their crownes from the Pope, and are not able
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18506:155"/>to defend themſelues and their ſubiects from the common enemy without the aide of other Chriſtian princes. further, if at any time the Emperors warred aganſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> abroad; then did the Popes by all meanes endeuor to take from them and their agents their townes and caſtles at home. they did alſo withdraw their ſupplies, and employ thoſe, that had vowed to ſerue againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> to ſerue againſt the Emperor, as <hi>Matth. Paris in Henrico</hi> 3. doth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie. <hi>Alexander the third</hi> ſent the ſoldan <hi>Fridericke Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſaes</hi> portrayt, then ſeruing againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> perſuading him to kill him, if he would ſettle his affaires. <hi>Gregory the</hi> 9. inuaded the emperors dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and drew <hi>Fride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke the</hi> 2. out of <hi>Aſia</hi> to defend his owne poſſeſſions at home, when he was almoſt in poſſeſſion of the victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade. <hi>Laſtly</hi> it is publikely knowne, that they haue ſet <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> together about the quarrell of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples. Innocent the thrid</hi> by his excommunication of king <hi>Iohn</hi> ſet both his ſubiects, and the <hi>French</hi> againſt him, and was the cauſe of the loſſe of <hi>Normandy</hi> to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. <hi>Iulian</hi> the Cardinall ſet the <hi>Germans</hi> againſt the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians. Paul the third</hi> was the principall motiue of the warres of <hi>Charles the ſift</hi> againſt the <hi>Germans.</hi> and to ſhut vp this diſcourſe in few words, not only <hi>Nicholas Machiauel</hi> in his <hi>Florentine</hi> hiſtory affirmeth, but alſo all hiſtories teſtifie, that the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> haue beene the principall cauſes of all the warres and ſtirres of <hi>Europe,</hi> that haue beene for this 4. or 5. hundred yeres laſt paſt. they are the cauſes of the maſſacres of <hi>France,</hi> of the troubles of the low-countries, of the late rebellions in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> of the contentions betwixt <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other countries.</p>
               <p>Fourthly the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> by deuiſing and confirming many orders of Monkes and friers, by admitting ſuch ſwarmes of idle lozels into orders, and mainteining them by chanting of Maſſes for ſoules, forcing them to forſweare mariage, haue not only cauſed many vnnatural murders, but alſo hindred the propagation and increaſe of men. they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18506:156"/>haue alſo withdrawne men from defence of the common-wealth, and placed them in dennes of licentious idleneſſe, and laid the charge of the common defence vpon few.</p>
               <p>Fiftly exempting both the goods and the perſons of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men and clerkes from common charges of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, they haue weakened the ſtates of princes, and laid all the burthen vpon the weakeſt part.</p>
               <p>Finally by their idolatries they haue diſpleaſed God, and by their periuries haue made good the leud cauſe of the Turkes. Therefore we are not to maruell, if the Chriſtians haue not proſpered in their expeditions into the holy land. for what ſucceſſe could Chriſtians looke for, conſidering the notorious abuſes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the army by worſhipping idoles, blaſpheming Gods holy name, violating Chriſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Euchariſt by celebration of prophane maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Could <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> king of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his army preuaile againſt the Turkes, hauing begun the warre contrary to arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of peace ſolemnely ſworne? but let vs mainteine the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt, and not of antichriſt, and let vs aboliſh the idolatrous worſhip of images, and the inuocation of ſaints, and let vs abandon the damned Maſſe, and ſerue God as he hath appointed, and finally let vs not violate our promiſes and oathes, nor abuſe gods holy name; and then, no doubt, but we ſhall proſper in all our enterpriſes againſt the Turke, or other enemies of the Church. for hitherto not the Turks forces, but the multitude of the ſinnes, idolatries, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and other abuſes of Chriſtians, haue made them flie before their enemies, and ouerthrowne their armies.</p>

               <p>And that this is true, it may be prooued by diuers parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. in time paſt the biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffered for true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. now they cut the throats of all ſuch as profeſſe truth.</p>
               <p>The ancient biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> fed Chriſts flocke, and were ſubiect to Chriſtian Emperours. now the Popes kill Chriſts lambes, and ſet their feete vpon the neckes of emperors.</p>
               <p>In the primitiue church holy ſcriptures were read in the church, and taken only for the word of God. but now in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church lying legends, and fables are read in the church, and lying and vncertaine traditions are made equall to ſcriptures.</p>

               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:18506:157"/>
               <p>The ancient biſhops of the church preached diligently, liued vprightly, dealt with their people mercifully. now the Popiſh biſhops preach not, nor leade their liues according to their profeſſion, but contrariwiſe liue ſcandalouſly, and are the only bouchers to murder all, that ſhall either repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the abuſes of the church, or their corruptions in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. and the powdermen and vndermining Papiſts follow their ſteppes.</p>
               <p>Ancient Chriſtians ſuffered moſt cruell torments and death, becauſe they would not worſhip images. now the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> put all to death, that will not worſhip images.</p>
               <p>The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> according to S. <hi>Paules</hi> doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued not <hi>to be inſtified by the workes of Gods lawe.</hi> the late <hi>Romaniſtes</hi> hope to bee iuſtified by the workes of the Popes Lawes.</p>
               <p>They looked for no peace by their owne ſatisfaction, but by the redemption wrought by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> theſe moderne fellowes beleeue, that they can ſatisfie for their owne ſinnes, and truſt in the redemption procured them by the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans,</hi> vnto whom <hi>S. Paul</hi> wrote, were obedient to Kings. theſe looſe the bonds betweene kings, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, and ſtirre vp traytors to blow vp their princes.</p>
               <p>They diligently obſerued Chriſts inſtitution in admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the ſacraments, and neither ſpit in the faces of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians baptized, nor ſtole away the cup from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants. the moderne Romiſh prieſts ſpit on thoſe, whom they baptize, and refuſe to adminiſter the cup to others then themſelues.</p>
               <p>Finally they are digreſſed from the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> in all thoſe particulars both concerning faith and maners, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue ſhewed, that they differ from ancient Catholikes, and haue deuiſed meere nouelties,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> That the Romiſh Church, that now is, was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in old time.</head>
               <p>MVch doe our aduerſaries boaſt of the viſibility of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, ſuppoſing, becauſe the ſcriptures ſpeake much of the glory of the kingdome of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that al that honor belongeth to the church of <hi>Rome</hi> of late times. but while they miſtake things ſpirituall for things corporall and externall, and ſuppoſe things vntrue, all this their boaſt and glory will turne to their great preiudice and ſhame. for firſt the beauty of the church conſiſteth rather in inward vertues, then in outward ſhewes and apparell. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, be it, that the church is alwaies ſeene and apparent to the true members of the church; yet the moderne <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, and the glory thereof was neuer ſeene either of the Apoſtles or ancient fathers of the Church, or of ancient Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>For what, I pray you, is the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people profeſſing the moderne ſaith of the Romiſh ſynagogue, &amp; communicating with the ſame in ſacraments, and ſubiecting themſelues to the Popes holineſſe? this is confirmed by the teſtimony of <hi>Bellarmine in his booke de ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia,</hi> and of <hi>Caniſius in his catechiſme c. de fide &amp; ſymbolo,</hi> and I hope will not be denied by any Papiſt. but ſuch a church ſhall neuer bee ſhewed in ancient time. and that we ſhall proue by inuincible reaſons. for firſt we finde not, during the time of the Apoſtles, any ſuch head of the church as the Pope, nor any ſuch ſholders, as the Cardinals, nor any ſuch rotten members, as the chantery prieſts ſinging Maſſes for ſoules departed, as Monkes liuing in heards like ſwine, as friers begging for faſhion ſake, and yet abounding in all things neceſſary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pope with his triple crowne, two ſwordes, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed pantofle, and his guard of <hi>Suizars,</hi> and purple Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18506:158"/>following him, began onely of late time to be viſible. if ſuch a ſight had appeared in the time of the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they would haue woondred at it, as a thing moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and vnbeſeeming him, that pretendeth to be the ſucceſſor of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. While S. <hi>Peter</hi> liued, no man euer ſaw a church perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of Chriſtes diſciples, and deliuering them ouer to haue their throates cut by the ſecular power. nor did either the biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the ancient fathers for more then a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt, impriſon, torment, or kill ſuch Chriſtians, as were not of their faction and opinion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ancient church of Chriſt did neither excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate kings, nor aſſoile their ſubiects from their obedience, commanding them vpon paine of excommunication to riſe vp in armes againſt them, and to depoſe them. the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church therefore, which doth all theſe things, was not then viſible. neither can any Maſſe-prieſt ſhew vs where in old time miners and powder-men ſought to blow vp the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall men of the ſtate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. So long as the primitiue church continued in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and ſteppes of the Apoſtles and ancient fathers, the ſame was ruled by the holy Scriptures, and canons of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and then the decretales of <hi>Gregory the</hi> 9. <hi>Boniface the</hi> 8. <hi>Clement the</hi> 5. <hi>Iohn the</hi> 22. and other later Popes were not in the world. who can then ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> church or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by theſe decretales was then viſible?</p>
               <p n="6">6. The moderno <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, beſide the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtituted by Chriſt, beleeue other 5. Sacraments, and hope as well to be ſaued by greaſing, when they lie a dying, as by Baptiſme, and the Lordes Supper. but ſuch a church was altogether inuiſible both in the Apoſtles time, and long after.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Now Papiſtes beleeue, that Chriſtians receiuing the Sacrament, ſwallow downe Chriſtes body into their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: nay they teach that dogs, hogs, and brute beaſts, eating conſecrated hoſtes, doe alſo deuoure Chriſts bodie. but ſuch a company of <hi>Canibals,</hi> and blaſphemers againſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:18506:159"/>Chriſtian religion were neuer taken for Chriſtes church, for more then a thouſand yeares after Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Roman</hi> church commandeth Chriſtians to keepe the feaſt daies of monkes and friers, and other ſaints, to heare Maſſe, vpon ember daies in Lent, and fridaies to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine from fleſh, to goe to auricular confeſſion at the leaſt once a yeare, and not to celebrate marriage vpon certaine daies. but if all the monkes and friers in the world were ſet to ſeeke ſuch a church, and if the Maſſe-prieſts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh.</hi> church were ioyned with them; yet could they not finde ſuch a church for a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt.</p>

In the <hi>Romiſh</hi> miſſals the prieſt praieth, that <hi>God would</hi> be pleaſed to accept of the body and blood of Chriſt, and that for the merits of the bleſſed virgin, of <hi>Coſmas</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi> and other ſaints. but where ſuch a wicked and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous company, as make not onely ſaints, but alſo the idolatrous Maſſe-prieſts mediators for the body and blood of Chriſt, haue beene reputed the church of Chriſt, and was viſible before theſe wicked miſſals were framed, we find not in any ancient record.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> church worſhippeth the croſſe and the images of the <hi>Trinity</hi> with <hi>Latria,</hi> or diuine worſhip. but ſuch a church for a thouſand yeares was neuer viſible in the world.</p>
               <p n="11">11. In the miſſals, breuiaries and other rituall bookes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church we finde diuers praiers and confeſſions to Angels, to the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other ſaints, nay to the croſſe and the image giuen to <hi>Veronica.</hi> and theſe praiers are both practiſed and defended by the church of <hi>Rome.</hi> but if all the Popes lanterne-bearers, and diſciples were ſet to ſeeke for ſuch a church in the time of the ancient fathers, they ſhould but loſe their labour, and ſpend their wits in vaine.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Apoſtles canons, as is ſaid, doe excommunicate ſuch, as doe not communicate being preſent at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Euchariſt. we may not therefore thinke, that the Romiſh ſynagogue was viſible in thoſe times, ſeeing they
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:18506:159"/>thinke it ſufficient for their diſciples, to be preſent at the Maſſe, although they receiue nothing.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In the primitiue church no man euer heard, that Chriſtians gaped and gazed on the prieſt adminiſtring the Lords ſupper, or that they receiued the one kinde, and not the other. the Popiſh church therefore in thoſe times was inuiſible.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In thoſe times alſo neither was the Euchariſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, nor the Scriptures read in tongues not vnderſtood of the multitude. nor did the people pray in ſtrange toongs, which they vnderſtood not. the miſſificall congregation therfore of papiſts, which pray, not knowing what they ſay, and being preſent at the reading of Scriptures, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments in ſtrange tongues, vnderſtand nothing, was not yet crept out of <hi>Cacus</hi> his denne, nor apparent in the world.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The moderne Papiſtes beleeue, that ſuch as in this life ſatisfie not for their ſinnes committed after Baptiſme, are to ſatisfie for the ſame in Purgatorie. They beleeue alſo, that the Pope by his indulgences is able to redeeme ſoules out of Purgatory, and to remit all the temporall paines due for ſinnes. but ſuch a church as this, was neuer to be ſeene for a thouſand yeeres after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To abridge this diſcourſe, it were an eaſie matter, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other points of faith, and diuers other cuſtomes in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the Sacraments, and diuers other formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment all newly inuented, practiſed and maintained by the ſynagogue of <hi>Rome,</hi> to declare and proue, that the ſame is a new model of a church neuer ſeene, nor knowne to anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. but by theſe few particulars the ſame doth moſt cleerely appeare already.</p>
               <p>If the Papiſts then ſeeke to bring vs backe to the formes of the ancient church; then muſt they abandon the Pope and his adherents, embracing the moderne faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of ſacraments lately broched by the idle ſchool-men, and confirmed in the late conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and adhere to the church of <hi>England,</hi> which as it profeſſeth the Apoſtles
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:18506:160"/>doctrine publiſhed by ancient councels of the church, ſo it renounceth all hereſies and nouclties brought in by Papiſts and other heretikes. and as it renounceth their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo it deteſteth their treacherous practiſes.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. LII.</hi> That the marks of the church, and motiues to the moderne Romiſh faith alledged by Papiſts, may as well be alledged by heathen men and Turkes, as by them.</head>
               <p>AL this notwithſtanding, the Papiſts challenge to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the name, title, and authority of the church, and bring foorth a whole ſquadron of motiues to draw ſimple ſoules to like of their ſect, and to intangle them with their errors. <hi>Bellarmine de notis eccleſ. c.</hi> 3. ſaith, that the proper markes of the church are theſe: <hi>the name of Catholikes, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, continuance, vniuerſality, ſucceſſion of Biſhops, conſent in doctrine, miracles, prophecies, temporall felicity, and ſuch like.</hi> others bring <hi>vnity, vniuerſality, holineſſe of life, and ſuch like. Briſtow</hi> in his <hi>Motiues</hi> ſtandeth vpon the names of <hi>Catholiks and Heretikes, miracles, viſions, ſcriptures, traditions, fathers, martyrs, going out, riſing afterward, ſucceſſion, immutability, vnitie, iudges infallible, obedient ſubiects, viſibility, and other markes of like nature.</hi> But as well may the <hi>Turkes</hi> and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous heathen nations alledge theſe markes and motiues, as the Papiſts: and ſome of them doe better agree to Turkes, and idolatrous <hi>Paynims,</hi> then to idolatrous and hereticall Papiſts.</p>
               <p>For as Papiſts call themſelues <hi>Catholikes,</hi> and giue the name of <hi>heretikes</hi> to others; ſo doe the <hi>Turkes</hi> cal themſelues <hi>Muſulman,</hi> or true beleeuers, and heathen idolaters called themſelues <hi>Pious</hi> worſhippers of the gods. and in regard of themſelues both <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Paynims</hi> take Chriſtians to be impious perſons, and heretikes. the <hi>Turkes</hi> call Papiſts
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:18506:160"/>idolaters, and the heathen in time paſt called Chriſtians <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for antiquitie, it agreeth farre better to <hi>Paynims</hi> and Turkes, then to Papiſts. for heathen idolatry was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the doctrine of Popery, and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient then the Popes decretales, that being publiſhed by <hi>Mahomet</hi> within 630. yeares after Chriſt, theſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and confirmed by <hi>Gregory the</hi> 9. who entred an. D. 1227.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Idolatry, as it beganne ſoone after the flood, ſo it hath euer ſince continued. the blaſphemous religion of Turkes har<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> continued euer ſince the time of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> but Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neuer receiued a perfect forme, before the conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> and in moſt places now is decaied.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The heathen idolaters alledge for themſelues ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and vniuerſality, as well as the Papiſts: and ſo may the Turkes alſo. for in time paſt all nations worſhipped idoles, faue the <hi>Iewes:</hi> and in our times farre more nations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his prieſts, then by the Pope and his Maſſe-prieſts, the Popes doctrine being confined within a few nations of <hi>Europe, Mahometiſme</hi> poſleſſing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Afrike,</hi> and no ſmall parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Turkes euer ſince <hi>Mahomet</hi> haue had a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Caliphaes</hi> and prieſts, and among the heathen there neuer wanted a diſcent of ſacrificing idolaters. but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts cannot deriue their ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their in doctrine or diſcent of Popes. for neither is their doctrine apoſtolicall, nor are the Popes the Apoſtles ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors. beſide that, they are vncerteine, both who were true Popes, and which ſucceded after <hi>Peter,</hi> and diuers biſhops and Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The <hi>Paynims</hi> with one conſent in time paſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped idoles, neither did any one among them call the matter in queſtion. the Turks are ſo reſolute in religion, that they will haue no diſputing againſt any point of their doctrine. but Popiſh ſchoolemen call all points of their religion in queſtion. neither doe they ſo well agree in any article, but
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:18506:161"/>there be ſome, that hold ſingular opinions. the <hi>Scotiſts</hi> differ from the <hi>Thomiſtes,</hi> and diuers opinions are holden by the canoniſts contrary to the ſchoolemen. of late in <hi>England</hi> the Iebuſites and ſecular prieſts did contend about diuers queſtions, and now the difference is rather ſtopped, then ended.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the <hi>Alchoran</hi> the Turkes pretend, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> did diuers miracles. we reade alſo, that the gentiles tell of diuers woonders done by their gods, and their ſooth-ſaiers and Prieſts. <hi>Nauius,</hi> as <hi>Liuy</hi> telleth vs, cut a whetſtone in ſunder with a razor. the papiſts therefore haue no reaſon to ſtand ſo much vpon miracles.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Mahomet</hi> alſo is ſaid to haue foretold things to come, and the gentiles alledge innumerable oracles of their gods concerning future matters, which as they ſay were verified by the euents. if you compare the prophecies of the legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſaints, there is no reaſon why they ſhould be preferred before the other.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In temporall matters both Turks and heathen empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors haue had farre better ſucceſſe then the Papiſts. the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperors being pagans ruled the world, and now the Empire of Turkes is more large, then that of the Pope; nay of late time the Popes haue made few attempts againſt the Turks, that haue proſpered. if then we iudge of matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to outward ſucceſſe; then are the Papiſts vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Turkes and Paynims haue beene better vnited among themſelues, then the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. In the Romiſh church we reade of 27. or more ſchiſmes. but neither haue the idolatrous prieſts, nor the <hi>Caliphaes</hi> and prieſts of the Turkes beene ſo diuided.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Neither if we looke among the Emperors of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Turkiſh prieſts, ſhall we find more periured, luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable perſons, then <hi>Iohn the</hi> 12. <hi>Landus, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius the third, Gregory the</hi> 7. <hi>Sixtus the fourth, Alexander the ſixt, Paul the ſecond and third,</hi> and the bougerly Monkes and Maſſe-prieſts. holineſſe therefore can no more bee a
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:18506:161"/>marke of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> church, then of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims,</hi> and their congregations. nay among the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Paynims</hi> we neuer reade any ſuch bloody execution, as was intended by the popiſh faction in England againſt the king, and his houſe, and the whole ſtate.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>Paynims</hi> and <hi>Turkes</hi> being iudges, the Papiſts will be taken for heretikes, as well as others are condemned for heretikes by the Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It is before ſhewed, that <hi>Turkes</hi> doe as well eſteeme of ſcriptures as Papiſts, and no leſſe doe value their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then they. The heathen alſo with great ſolemnity loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into their oracles, and bookes of <hi>Sibylles,</hi> and had them in more reuerence, then the Papiſts haue their legendes and decretales.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Turkes</hi> no leſſe eſteeme their Saints and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, then the Papiſts eſteeme ſuch as died in the Popes quarrell. heathen men alſo ſtoode alwaies much vpon their forefathers, and had more reaſon to bragge of old cuſtoms, then the Papiſts, whoſe faſhions for the moſt part haue but a late beginning.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The Papiſts, we know, are a ſect going out of <hi>Chriſts</hi> church, and riſing long after Chriſts time, hauing not perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the confuſed <hi>Babell</hi> vntill the times of the conuenticle of <hi>Trent.</hi> but the heathen idolaters do fetch their pedegree from men, that liued before <hi>Moyſes</hi> his law, and the <hi>Turkes</hi> pretend great antiquity, and auerre, that the idolatrous pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are gone out of the church of God, and not they.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The mutabilitie of Popery is eaſily proued by their change of Lawes, alteration of gouemement, variety of old and new miſſals, breuiaries and other rituall bookes, by the difference betwixt the doctrine of ſchoole-men, and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and faith of the fathers, by their mutable rites, Saints, Saints daies, and calendars. but the heathen alledge, that they and their anceſters haue alwaies perſiſted in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their gods. and the <hi>Turkes</hi> doe firmely obſerue their Alchoran without addition or detraction.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Where the Papiſts talke of their infallible iudges, the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:18506:162"/>heathen idolaters and <hi>Turkes</hi> haue cauſe to laugh at them. for who is ſo deuoid of ſenſe, to ſuppoſe, that a Pope, that is ignorant of matters of faith, learning, and vertue, is a iudge of the myſteries of Chriſtian religion, and of matters of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? doe blind men iudge of colours, or deaſe men of ſounds? the <hi>Turkes</hi> aſſure themſelues, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> is a farre better iudge, then the Pope, and the old Romans doubted not, but that their <hi>Augures,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> knew more in religion, then the later Popes.</p>
               <p>Finally while the Papiſts leaue the doctrine of faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to holy ſcriptures, and the adminiſtration of ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and worſhip of God according to Chriſts inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other proper markes of the church, ſtanding who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the luſtre of the world, and outward markes and ſignes of their Satanicall Synagogue; they alledge nothing, which the very heathen idolaters and <hi>Turkes,</hi> cannot bring with better reaſon, then they.</p>

Againe, who called in the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Lombards,</hi> but the Popes of <hi>Rome?</hi> Thirdly, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſonnes of <hi>Henry the</hi> 4. and <hi>Fredericke the</hi> 2. and of <hi>Lewis</hi> the piteous, to rebell againſt their parents, but the Pope and Popiſh prelates?

Finally who oppugned king <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and fought againſt the Emperors formerly named? were they not all Papiſts, and the Popes vaſſals, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Emperors and kings ſubiects? it cannot be denied. For by the Popes excommunications, they were deterred from their obedience and dutie; and honoring antichriſt for Chriſtes vicar, at his commandement they oppugned their lawfull princes.</p>
               <p>To come neerer to our ſelues and our times, we ſinde that the rebels of Yorkeſhire and Lincolneſhire in king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the</hi> 8. his daies, were papiſtes. for their enſignes were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices and maſſe-cakes, and the fiue woundes, and their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſtirrers were monkes and maſſe-prieſts, and their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men ſuperſtitiouſly affected. likewiſe the rebels in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uonſhire and Cornewall in king <hi>Edwards</hi> daies, were men wholly addicted to Popery. they would haue their Maſſes and their dirges, their croſſes and their banners, their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and their Popiſh trinkets and ceremonies; or elſe they would haue their heads broken.</p>

               </p>
               <p>His Maieſtie alſo, that now raigneth, hath not found any ſo troubleſome, diſloyall and trecherous, as his ſubiects popiſhly affected. the Erle of <hi>Goury</hi> had brought too much popiſh leuaine out of <hi>Italy</hi> to be a good ſubiect. <hi>Watſon</hi> and

               <p>
                  <hi>Henry the</hi> 3. <hi>of France,</hi> was oppugned by no other then the popiſh leaguers. the duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his houſe were therein principall agents, and all the reſt were affected and deuoted to the Popes ſeruice. the <hi>Dominican</hi> friar, that moſt ſhamefully murdred his liege ſouereigne Lord, was the Popes vaſſall, and ſet on by the <hi>Iebuſites.</hi> the ſame facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtood in armes againſt king <hi>Henry the</hi> 4. now reigning, and not being able to reſiſt by force, by treaſon ſought to deſtroy him. <hi>Iohn Chaſtel</hi> a ſcholler of the Iebuſites, and <hi>Ghineard</hi> a Iebuſite were therefore executed. ſo alſo was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Barriere,</hi> that incited by Iebuſites and Maſſe-prieſtes came with a ful reſolution to take away his Soueraignes life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parſons, Campian,</hi> and other Maſſe-prieſts and Iebuſites, were ſent into <hi>England</hi> by the Pope for no other cauſe, then to make a ſide for the execution of the Popes bull, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Popes faculty granted to <hi>Campian</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>

               <p>Neither were <hi>Parry, Sauage, Ocollen, Yorke, Lopez, Squire</hi> and others, that haue beene executed for attempting either by the ſword, or by poiſon to take away the late Queenes life, ſet on by others, then the Pope and his bloody faction. God grant that his roiall Maieſty may eſcape their treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous plots, whoſe heads, no doubt, are as buſie plotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as they euer were againſt his predeceſſor. and that he neede not to doubt of it, they declared the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently in the treacherous plot of <hi>Brooke, Watſon, Clerke</hi> executed for the ſame at <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> but moſt cleerely was the ſame reſolued by the practiſe of <hi>Cateſby, Percy</hi> and <hi>Fauxe,</hi> and their intended rebellion and fiery treaſon.</p>
               <p>It may be the Pope and his faction will deny, that they are the authors of theſe ſtirres, rebellions and treaſons. but the Popes bulles, their owne hand-writings, their confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their euident acts of treaſon, the depoſition of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:18506:163"/>and the defences made by diuers Papiſts, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine theſe rebellions and treaſons, ſhall alwaies plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince them. <hi>Sanders</hi> in his booke <hi>de viſibili Monarchia</hi> doth mainteine the rebellion in the North againſt Queene <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> and both he and <hi>Briſtow</hi> and others doe number thoſe rebels among Popiſh martyres. <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> that ſtirred vp forraine enemies againſt his prince and country, and ſtood againſt his Prince, is worſhipped by the popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a great ſaint. <hi>Iames Clement</hi> that killed <hi>Henry the third</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was highly praiſed by <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> in his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. and al the ſeditious maſſe-prieſts, that came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſtirre rebellion are by little and litle put into the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of Martyrs, as dying for Popiſh religion, or rather for practiſing treaſon.</p>
               <p>Neither doe theſe acts of rebellion and treaſon proceed from ſodeine motions, but rather from the lawes &amp; rules of Popery. for <hi>firſt</hi> they hold, that the Pope is aboue the King, and hath power to depoſe him and to giue away his kingdome. if then the Pope doe depoſe the king, and giue away his Kingdome, all his Popiſh ſubiects muſt forſake him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> they teach that if the Pope doe commande the ſubiects to take armes againſt the King, that they are bound to rebell againſt him, and to lay hands vpon him, if they can, vpon paine of damnation; and this is meritorious in the opinion of the Pope. if then rebels be good ſubiects, then theſe fellowes may be reputed good ſubiects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly Cardinall Como</hi> in his letters written to <hi>Parry</hi> in the Popes name ſheweth, that it is meritorious to kill a king excommunicat; and ſo was both he and <hi>Iames Clement</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the <hi>Iebuſites</hi> and Maſſe-prieſts. and may a man, trow you, beleeue them to be good ſubiects, that thinke it lawfull to kill their leege-Lords vpon the Popes warrant?</p>
               <p>Laſtly they hold, that euery king, that is by the Pope ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicat and declared a tyrant, <hi>ipſo facto</hi> is depoſed, and may be ſlaine by any man. for ſo <hi>Emanuell Sa</hi> the <hi>Iebuſite</hi> doth determine in his aphoriſmes. ſome ſay further, that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:18506:164"/>an hereticall king <hi>ipſo facto</hi> loſeth his kingdome, and thoſe, that are not ſo forward, affirme notwithſtanding, that the Pope may aſſoile ſubiects from their obedience, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with oathes. but all ſuch deſerue the title of rebels and traitors, and thoſe kings ſtand in great danger, that truſt ſuch truſtleſſe and pretended ſubiects.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, that all Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> are not of this opinion. I grant it may be ſo <hi>de facto.</hi> but if they be true Papiſts, and truly deuoted to their holy father; then muſt they obey the Popes bulles and acknowledge his doctrine. and this the Maſſe-prieſts and <hi>Iebuſites,</hi> that lurke in diuers places of <hi>England</hi> attending their pray, both know and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe. for, as traitors, they teach conditionall obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Popes further pleaſure be knowen, they interteine intelligence with forraine enemies, they receiue their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Pope, they depend vpon him and not vpon the king, they are gouerned by the Popes lawes, and not by the kings lawes. Finally the 5. of Nouember laſt the <hi>Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> Maſſe-prieſts, and their adherents of the popiſh facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>England,</hi> determined to deſtroy the King and ſtate, and to make a generall inſurrection and maſſacre through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole kingdome; and had done their vttermoſt, if God had not preuented their malicious deſſines and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>They may alſo alledge in excuſe of papiſts, that to kings, that be of their owne religion, they are moſt obedient, and deuoutly affected. but firſt this obedience and deuotion is conditionall and temporary, that is, if, and ſo long, as the Pope commandeth not the contrary.</p>
               <p>For if the Pope excommunicate the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them the <hi>Catholike King,</hi> hee is in no better termes then others.</p>
               <p>The Emperors that were excommunicat by the Pope within theſe 3. or 4. hundred yeares were of the Popes reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. yet did it not auaile them. <hi>Henry the third</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was ſuperſtitiouſly addicted to Popery; yet was he murdred by a <hi>Dominican Frier.</hi> and <hi>Henry the fourth</hi> being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18506:164"/>to the Pope and ſcornefully whipped in the perſon of his ambaſſador, ſcaped not the blow of <hi>Iohn Chaſtel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> kings profeſſing Popiſh religion are not obeied in eccleſiaſticall matters. For as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth, they are no gouernours of the Church. others ſay they haue no power to make lawes concerning eccleſiaſticall cauſes. ſo it appeareth they loſe halfe their authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Bellarmine</hi> and others exempt the perſons of the Clergie from the iuriſdiction of temporall Lords. doth it not then appeare, that popiſh kings are Commanders but of one halfe of their ſubiects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtlie,</hi> they doe exempt the goods of the clergie from the diſpoſition of the Prince. ſo we may ſee, that the King loſeth halfe his reuenues, where popiſh religion beareth ſwaie.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore it is apparent by the premiſſes, that all true Papiſts profeſſing and practiſing the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, are vtter enemies, and in hart euill affected to Kings profeſſing a contrary religion, and depend on ſtrange and forreine Princes, rather then vpon their owne Kings. well they may temporize hauing diſpenſations for it: but if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity bee offred to the Pope and his faction, to ſhew their malice; we may aſſure our ſelues, we ſhall finde them like our Engliſh powder-men, that is traitors and enemies of the prince and ſtate. and Kings profeſſing Popery are but the Popes vaſſals, and vnderlings, and during the Popes good will and pleaſure. further they haue but halfe their kingly authority, and rule but halfe their ſubiects, and loſe halfe their reuenues. which whoſoeuer either teacheth or alloweth, he may ſay and ſweare obedience in temporall matters, as long as he liſt: but wiſe men will neuer hold him for other, then a temporary, and vndutifull ſubiect.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THere are many falſe prophets gone out into the world,</hi> ſaith <hi>S. Iohn</hi> 1. <hi>epist.</hi> 4. ſpeaking of his times. and <hi>Reuelat.</hi> 9. he telleth vs, that in the later times of the church, a ſtarre ſhall fall from heauen, and that he, that is ſignified by that ſtarre, ſhal open the bottomleſſe pit, out of the ſmoke wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall come locuſtes, that haue haire like women, teeth like lions, habergeons of iron, and tailes like ſcorpions. we may not therefore thinke, but that now alſo falſe prophets are ſtirring abroad, and that ſwarmes of locuſtes are flying in euery kingdome, ſeeking by glozing pretence to deceiue the ſimple, by viperous calumniations to bite true teachers, with armes to oppugne princes, and with the poiſon and reliques of their herolies to ſting and hurt all that ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the trueth.</p>
               <p>The Iebuſites and their conſorts the friers and Maſſe-prieſts pretend the ſauing of mens ſoules, but they are falſe teachers, and the very locuſtes mentioned by S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſent foorth by the Pope deſigned by the ſtarre <hi>Apocalypſ.</hi> 9. let all Papiſts therefore beware, how they liſten to their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticall and damnable doctrine, which who ſo beleeueth and followeth poſitiuely, cannot be ſaned.</p>
               <p>The word of God is true. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iohn Ren.</hi> 14. <hi>worſhip the beast and his image, and receiue his marke in his forehead, or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drinke of the wine of the wrath of God:</hi> afterward he ſaith, <hi>hee ſhall be tormented in fire and brimſtome before the holy Angels and before the Lambe.</hi> but whoſoeuer is reconciled to the Pope, and ſubmitteth himſelfe to the lawes and kingdome of antichriſt, doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the beaſt and his image. whoſoeuer openly profeſſeth
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:18506:165"/>Popery, receiueth the Popes marke in his forehead. whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer yeeldeth to the practiſe of Romiſh religion, receiueth his marke in his hand. let Papiſtes therefore ſtand vpon their guard, and looke well to their conſciences. for albeit <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> with all their skill haue endeuoured to prooue, that the Pope is not antichriſt, yet all <hi>Bellarmines</hi> wrangling diſcourſe is refuted in my fift booke, <hi>de Pontif. Rom.</hi> and <hi>Sanders</hi> his demonſtrations ſtande alſo diſſolued by M. <hi>Whitakers</hi> of pious memory. beſide that, neither they nor any of their conſorts can aſſigne any other ſtate, vnto whom theſe propheſies may ſo well agree, as to the Pope, and his kingdome. if then our reaſons cannot reſolue them, yet the perplexitie of our aduerſities in this controuerſie may helpe to informe them and perſwade them, that the beaſt there ſpoken of, is the Pope, and that his image is the Romiſh gouernment, whereby the old empire of <hi>Rome</hi> is in a certaine ſort repreſented and reſtored.</p>
               <p>Furthermore <hi>Apocalypſ.</hi> 22. we finde, that <hi>dogges, enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whoremongers, murtherers, idolaters, and whoſoeuer loueth or maketh lies,</hi> ſhal be excluded out of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. but like to dogges the Pope and his adherents refuſe Gods word preached vnto them, and teare them in pieces, that ſeeke to feed them with the bread of life. diuers of the Popes haue beene great Magicians, Necromancers, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanters, as <hi>Benet the</hi> 9. <hi>Gregory the</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>Sylueſter the</hi> 2. <hi>Paul the</hi> 3. and many of their followers follow alſo but too much this damnable practiſe. the Maſſe-prieſts like cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning enchanters, ſuppoſe that bread and wine is turned into fleſh and blood in their magicall Maſſes, they permit pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſtewes, keepe concubines, and to monkes, friers, and maſſe-prieſts forbid lawfull marriage. they haue murdred and maſſacred millions of Chriſtians, to erect and vphold their antichriſtian kingdome. the 5. of Nouember laſt, they attempted a treaſon neuer before heard of, minding to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King, his Lords, and the Commons aſſembled in parliament, and to maſſacre all oppoſite to them through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the realme. they erect idols in churches, and euerie
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:18506:166"/>corner of their ſtreetes, and in high waies, giuing <hi>latriam</hi> and diuine honour to the croſſe, and to the images of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> and calling the Sacrament <hi>their Lord and God,</hi> and making vowes, praiers, confeſſions to ſaints, and burning incenſe to images, and ſaying Maſſe in the honour of ſaints and angels. finally they doe not onely forge ſtanders againſt M. <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Caluin,</hi> and other true teachers, but alſo againſt vs all, as if we taught, that <hi>God is the author of ſinne,</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt deſpaired,</hi> that <hi>there is no hell but horror of conſcience,</hi> and ſuch like abhominable doctrines, which we expreſly deteſt. they giue out alſo, that <hi>we condemne good works,</hi> and <hi>teach rebellion,</hi> and their hearers delight to heare theſe lies.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> hauing rehearſed diuers works of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. and namely, <hi>adultery, fornication, vncleanneſſe, wantonneſſe, idolatrie, witchcraft,</hi> and diuers others of that nature, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, <hi>hereſie, ſeditions,</hi> he concludeth, <hi>that thoſe that doe ſuch things ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God.</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was any ſect more ſubject to theſe workes of the fleſh, then the Papiſts. their idolatries, hereſies, rebellions, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and witchcraft, I haue before noted. adultery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication they account to be ſmall ſinnes, <hi>c. at ſi clerici. de indicijs.</hi> their vnnaturall luſtes are teſtified in diuers records and bookes. their clergie cannot chooſe but be vncleane, when they reſuſe marriage, and forſweare it. their maſſacres and murders, and rebellions are recorded in many hiſtories. and the memory thereof will now be recorded in actes of parliament. that they allow publike ſtewes, themſelues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not. and doe they thinke, that wallowing like ſwine in their fleſhly workes, they ſhall be ſaued?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in the end of his Creed ſaith, it <hi>is not poſſible a man ſhould be ſaued vnleſſe he beleeue the catholike faith.</hi> but this catholike faith the Papiſts beleeue not intirely, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they giue to Chriſt humane fleſh, nor make him a perfect man, thruſting his body into a ſmall piece of bread, or rather into the accidents of bread, where it is neither ſeene nor felt, as other mens bodies are. further they doe
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18506:166"/>not beleeue his aſcenſion, or that he ſhall come from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to iudge quicke &amp; dead, as is conteined in that Creedo, making their followers beleeue, that his body is vpon euery altar, and not being able to deny, that he ſhall come out of the pixe, ſeeing they teach he is there.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour <hi>Chriſt Matth</hi> 15. teacheth vs, that ſuch wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in vaine, <hi>as teach for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> but the doctrine of Popery, as it addeth to ancient Catholike religion, is nothing but a maſſe of humane inuentions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, and precepts: their decretales are the Popes deuiſes: their formes of worſhip conteined in the miſſals and breui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries are merely humane.</p>
               <p>From mans deuiſe proceeded the popiſh worſhip of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints, Images. the moſt part of the reſolutions of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of conſciences is grounded on the Popes lawes, finallie the turnings, skippings, heauings, greaſings, ſpittings, and other ceremonies of Maſſe-prieſts and their followers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from mans inuention. Popery therefore by Chriſts rule is nothing but wearineſſe and vexation of mens ſoules, while they ſeeke to ſerue God by thoſe meanes.</p>
               <p>By the chapter <hi>ſi Papa. diſt.</hi> 40. we learne, that the Pope <hi>may be remiſſe and negligent in his office, and ſilent in teaching, and leade innumerable people with him into hell.</hi> but if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts are to adhere to the Pope, and to follow him; how can they eſcape when he leadeth them into hell, that they runne not headlong into hell themſelues alſo? If then they will not beleeue ſcriptures, nor fathers; yet their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees may teach them, that following the Pope innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Papiſts runne hedlong into hell.</p>
               <p>Beſides the teſtimonies of ſcriptures and fathers and the confeſſion of <hi>Boniface</hi> in the chapter <hi>ſi Papa. diſt.</hi> 40. diuers reaſons teach vs, that the Papiſts holding firmelie and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely the erroneous doctrine of the moderne church of Rome, cannot be ſaued. for firſt no man can come vnto the father but by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> as he teſtifieth of himſelfe <hi>Iohn</hi> 14: he ſheweth alſo, <hi>that he is the way the truth and the life.</hi> the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>teacheth vs,</hi> that there is no mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18506:167"/>God and man, <hi>but the man Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> but the Papiſts as they pretend, come to <hi>God</hi> not only by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by Angels and Saints. they ſeeke out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo new waies, &amp; content not themſelues with ſuch, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> taught vs. finally they beleeue, that the Pope by his indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and euery Maſſe-prieſt by his Maſſes is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme mens ſoules.</p>
               <p>Secondly he that buildeth his faith vpon other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Prophets, doth build vpon ſand, and not vpon a firme foundation. but the Papiſts build their faith vpon the Popes decretales, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnwritten and vncerteine traditions, vpon the doctrine of the Romiſh church, vpon miracles and propheſies repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Romiſh legends, and ſuch like fables. doe they not then build vpon rumous foundations?</p>
               <p>Thirdly the papiſts hope to be iuſtified by the law, and to be ſaued by their workes. But the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, that man is iuſtified without the workes of the law, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. that eternall life is the gift of God through <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly the law of God pronounceth him accurſed, that abideth not in all the words of the law to doe them. and a plaine matter it is, that no man can be ſaued, that wilfully breaketh Gods law and neuer ſoroweth, nor craueth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for his tranſgreſſion. but the Papiſtes teach doctrine contrary to Gods law, and enforce their followers to breake it, and that in diuers points. God commandeth vs to haue no other gods but him. but they honour the Sacrament, and the images of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and croſſe with diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. they doe alſo impart Gods worſhip to the virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and to ſaints. he forbiddeth the taking of Gods holie name in vaine. the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> doe diſpenſe with oathes, and enforce men oftentimes to breake them. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs to honour our parents. the Pope ſetteth the children againſt their parents. finally, they allow publike ſtewes, and ſet vp ſhops of vſury, and maſſacre innocent Chriſtians, directly againſt Gods commandement, and that
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:18506:167"/>without all remorſe of conſcience, or feeling of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, papiſtes hope to obteine remiſhon of ſinnes by their owne ſatisfactions, by indulgences, by the paines of Purgatorie, by maſſes, by auricular confeſſ. on, and popiſh abſolution of Maſſe-prieſtes, and diuers humane deuiſes. but relying vpon theſe broken reedes, there is no hope for them to be ſaued for without the onely ſacrifice of <hi>Christ Ieſus</hi> applied to vs by true faith, there is no hope of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, without true faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God. but their peruerſe doctrine of faith, and the innumerable hereſies of papiſts do declare, that they haue no true faith.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, the Prophet <hi>Dauid Pſal.</hi> 15. demanding who ſhall reſt vpon Gods holy mountaine, anſwereth among other things, <hi>he that ſlandreth not with his tongue, nor doth euil to his neighbour.</hi> but the Papiſts, as is formerly ſhewed, haue no other meanes to vphold their ruinous ſtate, but by lies and ſlanders, treaſons, rebellions, murders, and maſſacres of innocent Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Finally, it is not poſſible, they ſhould be ſaued, that are ignorant of the meanes of their ſaluation, and hold hereſies repugnant to the apoſtles doctrine of the law, of the goſpel, of repentance from dead workes, and other articles of the faith. but the Papiſts beleeue, that Chriſt is only the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of their ſaluation, as if he had merited only, that they might ſauſe themſelues, they teach alſo, that men are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified formally by their owne works, &amp; that their ſuppoſed ſacraments, and their pilgrimages, and voluntary obſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the precepts of the Romiſh church, and works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed according to the Popes decretales, and conuenticle of <hi>Trent,</hi> do iuſtifie. Laſtly they teach and beleeue doctrine contrary to the law, to the goſpel, to the Apoſtles doctrine of repentance and good works. are they not then in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſe?</p>
               <p>Now if any man aske, what is then become of all thoſe, that either now die, or in time paſt are dead in places where Popery is, or hath beene profeſſed? I anſwer: that of thoſe,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:18506:168"/>that held the foundation, and liued well, we hope well. but we denie that ſuch as liued before the conuenticle of <hi>Trent</hi> held Popery poſitiuely. we hope alſo, that many there are among the papiſts now, which conform themſelues to them in outward ceremonies, and yet beleeue not the errors of Popery poſitiuely, but hold themſelues to the old Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſaith. and of theſe mens ſaluation we haue no cauſe to deſpaire. God grant that the reſt alſo may reuoke their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, ſee their deformities, returne with a ſincere heart to Gods true church, and ſo be ſaued.</p>

               <p>THus we ſee, and I pray God all Chriſtians may dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider, what is meant by popiſh religion. brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is a collection of diuers corruptions and errors main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by the Pope and his adherents, either contrary, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Apoſtles doctrine. this religion we haue ſhewed to haue beene built vpon weake, vncerteine and ſalſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; and auerre, that it is contrarie to the doctrine of Gods law, and of true faith and iuſtification through <hi>Chriſt.</hi> the ſame alſo teacheth erroneouſly of the Goſpell, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth the merits of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our mediator and redeemer.</p>
               <p>Further, it hath corrupted the doctrine of the ſacraments, and brought in many old and new hereſies. it is compacted of diuers impieties, blaſphemies and idolatries, and neuer came from <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> it was neuer taught by the Prophets or Apoſtles, nor profeſſed by ancient Chriſtian Kings.</p>
               <p>It is not that religion, to which the ancient <hi>Britans</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> were conuerted, nor doth it deſerue to be called Catholike, or ancient. it is found to be repugnant to anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent councels, and to the faith of the ancient fathers.</p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:18506:168"/>
               <p>It is a religion diuers from that of the ancient Martyrs of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> A religion deuiſed by man, and not deriued out of holy ſcriptures. A religion whoſe founders &amp; defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders doe wickedly wreſt and abuſe ſcriprures, fathers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers.

A religion keeping Chriſtians in ignorance of true pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, and looſing the reines to all voluptuouſneſſe and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. A religion deuoid of good workes and piety. A religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that maketh a baſe accompt of Gods people, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth doctrines of Diuels. A religion of whoſe grounds and doctrines the profeſſors thereof haue no aſſurance. A religion repugnant to lawes of nations, of kinred, alliance and common ciuilitie. A religion preiudiciall to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kings, and dangerous in regard of their ſtates and perſons.

A religion without true biſhops and prieſts, and wholy mainteined by falſe allegations, forgeries, calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, lies, fire and ſword, periury and breach of couenant.

A religion profeſſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated <hi>Romans,</hi> neither for faith, nor life comparable to their anceſters, and by a church, that was neuer viſible vntill of late time, nor can ſhew better markes, or bring better motiues to induce men to embrace her doctrine, then the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Paynims.</hi> To conclude, a religion, whoſe profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors can neither be eſteemed true ſubiects, nor true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor iuſtlie pretend either aſſurance, or hope of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
               <p>I doe therefore exhort all true Chriſtians, as they deſire either that the true faith of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> may be publikely
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18506:169"/>receiued, or that doctrines contrary to piety, Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, policy, reaſon and common humanity may be ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to beware of the leuain of Popery, &amp; to concurre with thoſe, which both teach and ſet forward the true Catholike faith according to the doctrine of the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and which ſeeke to reſiſte all corruptions, falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, ſects and hereſies, and to roote vp the ſeeds of all trecherie and rebellion.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide I beſeech all Papiſts, to caſt away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and paſſion, and diligently to conſider of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes: that as they profeſſe themſelues true ſubiects, &amp; wel affected to Catholike, &amp; the ancient religion of the church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo they may abhorre their former treaſons and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, deteſt the maſſe-prieſts and powder-men their conſorts, reiect all hereſies, errors, and falſe doctrines maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with glorious titles of vniuerſality and antiquity, and ſet foorth by the Pope and his complices, teaching a late particular faith, and finally endeuour to be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into that ſociety, whereof Chriſt is the head, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which there is no ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The God of all truth confirme and eſtabliſh all true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in truth, and diſcouer all trecheries and errors, that ſuch as now are diſloially minded, and wander aſtray, may acknowledge their former diſloialties and errors, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true Catholike faith, and that ſuch as ſtand may be confirmed in the truth, that ſo both they and we iointly may liue loyally vnder our Princes, and truely ſerue one true and euerliuing God, and glorifie his holy name through Chriſt our Lord, to whom together with the Father and the holy Ghoſt, three perſons and one God, we render all praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour now and for euer.</p>
